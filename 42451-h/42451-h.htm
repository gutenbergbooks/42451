<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p>From time immemorial women have been content
to be as those who serve. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Non ministrari
sed ministrare</i>&mdash;not to be ministered unto but
to minister&mdash;is not alone the motto of those
who stand under the Wellesley banner, but of
true women everywhere.</p>

<p>For centuries a woman's own home had not
only first claim, but full claim, on her fostering
care. Her interests and sympathies&mdash;her
mother love&mdash;belonged only to those of her own
household. In the days when much of the labor
of providing food and clothing was carried
on under each roof-tree, her service was necessarily
circumscribed by the home walls.
Whether she was the lady of a baronial castle,
or a hardy peasant who looked upon her work
within doors as a rest from her heavier toil in
the fields, the mother of the family was not only
responsible for the care of her children and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
prudent management of her housekeeping, but
she had also entire charge of the manufacture of
clothing, from the spinning of the flax or wool to
the fashioning of the woven cloth into suitable
garments.</p>

<p>Changed days have come, however, with
changed ways. The development of science
and invention, which has led to industrial progress
and specialization, has radically changed
the woman's world of the home. The industries
once carried on there are now more efficiently
handled in large factories and packing-houses.
The care of the house itself is undertaken
by specialists in cleaning and repairing.</p>

<p>Many women, whose energies would have
been, under former conditions, inevitably monopolized
by home-keeping duties, are to-day
giving their strength and special gifts to social
service. They are the true mothers&mdash;not
only of their own little brood&mdash;but of the community
and the world.</p>

<p>The service of the true woman is always
"womanly." She gives something of the fostering
care of the mother, whether it be as
nurse, like Clara Barton; as teacher, like Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
Lyon and Alice Freeman Palmer; or as social
helper, like Jane Addams. So it is that the
service of these "heroines" is that which only
women could have given to the world.</p>

<p>Many women who have never held children
of their own in their arms have been mothers
to many in their work. It was surely the
mother heart of Frances E. Willard that made
our "maiden crusader" a helper and healer, as
well as a standard bearer. It was the mother
heart of Alice C. Fletcher, that made that student
of the past a champion of the Indians in
their present-day problems and a true "campfire
interpreter." It was the woman's tenderness
that made Mary Slessor, that torch-bearer
to Darkest Africa, the "white mother" of all
the black people she taught and served.</p>

<p>The Russian peasants have a proverb: "Labor
is the house that Love lives in." The
women, who, as mothers of their own families,
or of other children whose needs cry out for
their understanding care, are always homemakers.
And the work of each of these&mdash;her
labor of love&mdash;is truly "a house that love lives
in."</p>

<h2><span class="larger">HEROINES OF SERVICE</span></h2>

<h2>PROPHET AND PIONEER</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">"W</span><span class="dropleftmin">HAT</span> is my little Mistress Mary trying
to do?" The whir of the spinning-wheel
was stilled for a moment as Mrs. Lyon
glanced in surprise at the child who had climbed
up on a chair to look more closely at the hourglass
on the chimneypiece.</p>

<p>"I am just trying to see if I can find the
way to make more time," replied Mary.</p>

<p>"That's not the way, daughter," laughed
the busy mother, as she started her wheel
again. "When you stop to watch time, you
lose it. Let your work slip from your fingers
faster than the sand slips&mdash;that's the way to
make time!"</p>

<p>If busy hands can indeed make time, we know
why the days were so full of happy work in
that little farm-house among the hills of western
Massachusetts. It takes courage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
ceaseless toil to run a farm that must provide
food and clothing for seven growing children,
but Mrs. Lyon was never too busy or too tired
to help a neighbor or to speak a word of cheer.</p>

<p>"How is it that the widow can do more for
me than any one else?" asked a neighbor who
had found her a friend in need. "She reminds
me of what the Bible says, 'having nothing yet
possessing all things.' There she is left without
a husband to fend for her and the children,
so that it's work, work, work for them
all from morning till night, and yet they're
always happy. You would think the children
liked nothing better than doing chores."</p>

<p>"How is it that the harder a thing is the
more you seem to like it, Mary?" asked her
seat-mate in the district school, looking wonderingly
at the girl whose eyes always brightened
and snapped when the arithmetic problems
were long and hard.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's lots more fun <i>climbing</i> than just
going along on the level," replied Mary.
"You feel so much more alive. I'll tell you
what to do when a thing seems hard, like a
steep, steep hill, you know. Say to yourself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
'Some people may call you Difficulty, old hill;
but I know that your name is Opportunity.
You're here just to prove that I can do something
worth while.' Then the climbing is the
best fun&mdash;really!"</p>

<p>It is a happy thing to be born among the
hills. Wherever one looks there is something
to whisper: "There is no joy like climbing.
Besides, the sun stays longer on the summit,
and beyond the hill-tops is a larger, brighter
world." Perhaps it was the fresh breath of
the hills that gave Mary Lyon her glowing
cheeks, as the joy of climbing brought the dancing
lights into her clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>The changing seasons march over the hills in
a glorious pageant of color, from the tender
veiling green of young April to the purple
mists and red-and-gold splendor of Indian summer.
Every day had the thrill of new adventure
to Mary Lyon, but perhaps she loved the
mellow October days best. "They have all the
glowing memory of the past summer and the
promise of the spring to come," she used to
say.</p>

<p>How could one who had, through the weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of growing things, worked together with rain
and sunshine and generous earth for the harvest
but feel the happy possession of all the
year at the time when she saw bins overflowing
with brown potatoes, yellow corn, and other
gifts of fields and orchard? She could never
doubt that, given the waiting earth and faithful
labor, the harvest was sure. Duties and
difficulties were always opportunities for
higher endeavor and happier achievement.</p>

<p>There was no play in Mary Lyon's childhood
except the play that a healthy, active
child may find in varied, healthful work done
with a light heart. There was joy in rising
before the sun was up, to pick weeds in the
dewy garden, to feed the patient creatures in
the barn, and to make butter in the cool spring-house.
Sometimes one could meet the sunrise
on the hill-top, when it happened to be one's
turn to bring wood to the dwindling pile by the
kitchen door. Then there was the baking&mdash;golden-brown
loaves of bread and tempting
apple pies. When the morning mists had
quite disappeared from the face of the hills,
the blue smoke had ceased to rise from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
chimney of the little farm-house. Then was
the time to sit beside Mother and knit or weave,
sew or mend, the garments that were homemade,
beginning with the moment when the
wool, sheared from their own sheep, was
carded and spun into thread. For holidays,
there were the exciting mornings when they
made soap and candles, or the afternoons when
they gathered together in the barn for a husking-bee.</p>

<p>Beauty walked with Toil, however, about
that farm in the hills. Mary had time to lift
up her eyes to the glory of the changing sky
and to tend the pinks and peonies that throve
nowhere so happily as in her mother's old-fashioned
garden.</p>

<p>"May I plant this bush in the corner with
your roses?" asked a neighbor one day. "It
is a rare plant of rare virtue, and I know that in
your garden it cannot die."</p>

<p>As the labor of her hands prospered, as her
garden posies blossomed, so the wings of Mary
Lyon's spirit grew. No matter how shut in the
present seemed, no hope nor dream for the future
died in her heart as the days went by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Her plans only took deeper and deeper root
as she worked and waited patiently for the time
of flowers and fruit. There were few books to
be had, but these yielded her of their best.
There was opportunity for but few scattered
terms in distant district schools, but she learned
there more than the teachers taught.</p>

<p>"Anything is interesting when you realize
that it is important," she used to say. And to
Mary everything was important that was real.
She learned not only from books, but from
work, from people, from Nature, and from
every bit of stray circumstance that came her
way. It is said that when the first brick house
was built in the village she made a point of
learning how to make bricks, turning them up,
piling them on the wheelbarrow, and putting
them in the kiln. She was always hungry to
know and to do, and the harder a thing was the
more she seemed to like it. Climbing was ever
more fun than trudging along on the level.</p>

<p>The years brought changes to the home farm.
The older sisters married and went to homes of
their own. When Mary was thirteen her
mother married again and went away with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
younger children, leaving her to keep house for
the only brother, who had from early childhood
been her best comrade. The dollar a week
given her for her work was saved to pay for a
term in the neighboring academy. She also
taught in a district school for a while, receiving
seventy-five cents a week and board.</p>

<p>The nineteen-year-old girl who appeared one
day at the Ashfield Academy somehow drew
all eyes to her. Her blue homespun dress,
with running-strings at neck and waist, was
queer and shapeless, even judged by village
standards in the New England of 1817. Her
movements were impulsive and ungainly and
her gait awkward. But it was not the crudity,
but the power, of the new-comer that impressed
people. Squire White's gentle daughter, the
slender, graceful Amanda, gave the loyalty of
her best friendship to this interesting and enthusiastic
schoolmate from the hill farm.</p>

<p>"She is more alive than any one I know,
Father," said the girl, in explanation of her
preference. "You never see her odd dress and
sudden ways when once you have looked into
her face and talked to her. Her face seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
lighted from within&mdash;it isn't just her bright
color and red-gold curls; it isn't even her
merry laugh. I can't explain what I mean, but
it seems as if her life touches mine&mdash;and it's
such a big, warm, beautiful life!"</p>

<p>The traditions of this New England village
long kept the memory of her first recitation.
On Friday she had been given the first lesson
of Adams's Latin Grammar to commit to
memory. When she was called up early Monday
afternoon, she began to recite fluently
declensions and conjugations without pause,
until, as the daylight waned, the whole of the
Latin grammar passed in review before the
speechless teacher and dazzled, admiring pupils.</p>

<p>"How did you ever do it? How could your
head hold it all?" demanded Amanda, with a
gasp, as they walked home together.</p>

<p>"Well, really, I'll have to own up," said
Mary, with some reluctance, "I studied all day
Sunday! It wasn't so very hard, though. I
soon saw where the changes in the conjugations
came in, and the rules of syntax are very
much like English grammar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Studying was never hard work to Mary, because
she could at a moment's notice put all
her attention on the thing at hand. Her busy
childhood had taught her to attack a task at
once, while others were frequently spending
their time thinking and talking about doing it.</p>

<p>"No one could study like Mary Lyon, and
no one could clean the school-room with such
despatch," said one of her classmates.</p>

<p>It seemed as if she never knew what it was
to be tired. She appeared to have a boundless
store of strength and enthusiasm, as if,
through all her growing years, she had made
over into the very fiber of her being the energy
of the life-giving sunshine and the patience of
the enduring hills. Time must be used wisely
when all one's little hoard of savings will only
pay for the tuition of one precious term. Her
board was paid with two coverlets, spun, dyed,
and woven by her own hands.</p>

<p>"They should prove satisfactory covers," she
said merrily, "for they have covered all my
needs."</p>

<p>On the day when she thought she must bid
farewell to Ashfield Academy the trustees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
voted her free tuition, a gift which, as pupil-teacher,
she did her best to repay. The hospitable
doors of Squire White's dignified residence
were thrown open to his daughter's
chosen friend, and in this second home she
readily absorbed the ways of gracious living&mdash;the
niceties and refinements of dress and manners
for which there had been no time in the
busy farm-house.</p>

<p>When the course at the academy was completed,
the power of her eager spirit and evident
gifts led Squire White to offer her the
means to go with his daughter to Byfield Seminary
near Boston, the school conducted by Mr.
Joseph Emerson, who believed that young
women, no less than their brothers, should have
an opportunity for higher instruction. In
those days before colleges for women or normal
schools, he dreamed of doing something
towards giving worthy preparation to future
teachers. It was through the teaching and inspiration
of this cultured Harvard scholar and
large-hearted man that Mary Lyon learned to
know the meaning of life, and to understand
aright the longings of her own soul. Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
afterward she said: "In my youth I had much
vigor&mdash;was always aspiring after something.
I called it longing to study, but had few to direct
me. One teacher I shall always remember.
He taught me that education was to fit one to
do good."</p>

<p>On leaving Byfield Seminary, Miss Lyon began
her life-work of teaching. But with all her
preparation for doing and her intense desire
to do, she did not at first succeed. The matter
of control was not easy to one who would not
stoop to rigid mechanical means and who said,
"One has not governed a child until she makes
the child smile under her government." Besides,
her sense of humor&mdash;later one of her chief
assets&mdash;seemed at first to get in the way of her
gaining a steady hold on the reins.</p>

<p>When she was tempted to give up in discouragement,
she said to herself: "I know that
good teachers are needed, and that I ought to
teach. 'All that ought to be done can be
done.'"</p>

<p>To one who worked earnestly in that spirit,
success was sure. Five years later, two towns
were vying with each other to secure her as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
teacher in their academies for young ladies.
For some time she taught at Derry, New Hampshire,
during the warm months, going to her
beloved Ashfield for the winter term. Wherever
she was she drew pupils from the surrounding
towns and even from beyond the borders
of the State. Teachers left their schools
to gather about her. She had the power to
communicate something of her own enthusiasm
and vitality. Bright eyes and alert faces testified
to her power to quicken thought and to
create an appetite for knowledge.</p>

<p>"Her memory has been to me continually
an inspiration to overcome difficulties," said
one of her pupils.</p>

<p>"You were the first friend who ever pointed
out to me defects of character with the expectation
that they would be removed," another pupil
wrote in a letter of heartfelt gratitude.</p>

<p>At this time all the schools for girls, like the
Ashfield Academy and Mr. Emerson's seminary
at Byfield, were entirely dependent upon the
enterprise and ideals of individuals. There
were no colleges with buildings and equipment,
such as furnished dormitories, libraries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
laboratories, belonging to the work and the future.
In the case of the most successful
schools there was no guarantee that they would
endure beyond the lifetime of those whose interest
had called them into being.</p>

<p>Miss Lyon taught happily for several years,
often buying books of reference and material
for practical illustration out of her salary of
five or six dollars a week. The chance for personal
influence seemed the one essential.
"Never mind the brick and mortar!" she cried.
"Only let us have the living minds to work
upon!"</p>

<p>As experience came with the years, however,
as she saw schools where a hundred young
women were crowded into one room without
black-boards, globes, maps, and other necessaries
of instruction&mdash;she realized that something
must be done to secure higher schools for
girls, that would have the requisite material
equipment for the present and security for the
future. "We must provide a college for young
women on the same conditions as those for
men, with publicly owned buildings and fixed
standards of work," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
This idea could appeal to most people of that
day only as a strange, extravagant, and dangerous
notion. Harvard and Yale existed to
prepare men to be ministers, doctors, and lawyers.
Did women expect to thrust themselves
into the professions? Why should they
want the learning of men? It could do nothing
but make them unfit for their proper life in
the home. Who had ever heard of a college
for girls! What is unheard of is to most people
manifestly absurd.</p>

<p>To Mary Lyon, however, difficulties were opportunities
for truer effort and greater service.
She had, besides, a faith in a higher power&mdash;in
a Divine Builder of "houses not made with
hands"&mdash;which led her to say with unshaken
confidence, "'All that ought to be done can be
done!'"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
  <img id="i_image017" src="images/image017.jpg" width="417" height="590" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption">Mary Lyon chapel and administration hall
</div></div>

<p>It was as if she were able to look into the
future and see the way time would sift the
works of the present. Those who looked into
her earnest blue eyes, bright with courage,
deep with understanding, could not but feel
that she had the prophet's vision. It was as
if she had power to divine the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the difficult and the impossible, and,
knowing that, her faith in the happy outcome
of her work was founded on a rock.</p>

<p>It took this faith and hope, together with an
unfailing charity for the lack of vision in others
and an ever-present sense of humor, to carry
Mary Lyon through the task to which she now
set herself. She was determined to open people's
eyes to the need of giving girls a chance
for a training that would fit them for more useful
living by making them better teachers,
wiser home-makers, and, in their own right,
happier human beings. She must not only
convince the conservative men and women of
her day that education could do these things,
but she must make that conviction so strong
that they would be willing to give of their hard-earned
substance to help along the good work.</p>

<p>Those were not the days of large fortunes.
Miss Lyon could not depend upon winning the
interest of a few powerful benefactors. She
must enlist the support of the many who would
be willing to share their little. She must perforce
have the hardihood of the pioneer, no
less than the vision of the seer, to enable her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to meet the problems, trials, and rebuffs of the
next few years.</p>

<p>"I learned twenty years ago not to get out
of patience," she once said to some one who
marveled at the unwearied good-humor with
which she met the most exasperating circumstances.</p>

<p>First enlisting the assistance of a few earnest
men to serve as trustees and promoters
of the cause, she, herself, traveled from town
to town, from village to village, and from house
to house, telling over and over again the story
of the Mount Holyoke to be, and what it was to
mean to the daughters of New England. For
the site in South Hadley, Massachusetts, had
been early selected, and the name of the neighboring
height, overlooking the Connecticut
River, chosen by the girl who was born in the
hills and who believed that it was good to
climb.</p>

<p>"I wander about without a home," she wrote
to her mother, "and scarcely know one week
where I shall be the next."</p>

<p>All of her journeying was by stage, for at
that time the only railroad in New England was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the one, not yet completed, connecting Boston
with Worcester and Lowell. To those who
feared that even her robust health and radiant
spirit could not long endure the strain of such
a life, she said: "Our personal comforts are
delightful, but not essential. Mount Holyoke
means more than meat and sleep. Had I a
thousand lives, I would sacrifice them all in
suffering and hardship for its sake."</p>

<p>During these years Miss Lyon abundantly
proved that the pioneer does not live by bread
alone. Only by the vision of what his struggles
will mean to those who come after to profit
by his labors is his zeal fed. It seemed at
the time when Mount Holyoke was only a
dream of what might be, and in the anxious
days of breaking ground which followed, that
Miss Lyon's faith that difficulties are only opportunities
in disguise was tried to the utmost.
Just when her enthusiasm was arousing in the
frugal, thrifty New Englanders a desire to
give, out of their slender savings, a great financial
panic swept over the country.</p>

<p>Miss Lyon's friends shook their heads.
"You will have to wait for better times," they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
said. "It is impossible to go on with the undertaking
now."</p>

<p>"When a thing ought to be done, it cannot
be impossible," replied Miss Lyon. "<i>Now</i> is
the only word that belongs to us; with the afterwhile
we have nothing to do."</p>

<p>In that spirit she went on, and in that spirit
girls who had been her pupils gave of their
little stipends earned by teaching, and the
mothers of girls gave of the money earned by
selling eggs and braiding palm-leaf hats.</p>

<p>"Don't think any gift too small," said Miss
Lyon. "I want the twenties and the fifties,
but the dollars and the half-dollars, with
prayer, go a long way."</p>

<p>So Mount Holyoke was built on faith and
prayer and the gifts of the many who believed
that the time cried out for a means of educating
girls who longed for a better training.
One hard-working farmer with five sons to educate
gave a hundred dollars. "I have no
daughters of my own," he said, "but I want to
help give the daughters of America the chance
they should have along with the boys." Two
delicate gentlewomen who had lost their little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
property in the panic, earned with their own
hands the money they had pledged to the college.</p>

<p>Even Miss Lyon's splendid optimism had,
however, some chill encounters with smallmindedness
in people who were not seldom
those of large opportunities. Once when she
had journeyed a considerable distance to lay
her plans before a family of wealth and influence
in the community, she returned to her
friends with a shade of thought on her cheerful
brow. "Yes, it is all true, just as I was
told," she said as if to herself. "They live in a
costly house, it is full of costly things, they
wear costly clothes&mdash;but oh, they're <i>little bits
of folks</i>!"</p>

<p>Miss Lyon, herself, gave to the work not only
her entire capital of physical strength and her
gifts of heart and mind, but also her small savings,
which had been somewhat increased by
Mr. White's prudent investments. And for
the future she offered her services on the same
conditions as those of the missionary&mdash;the
means of simple livelihood and the joy of the
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
"Mount Holyoke is designed to cultivate the
missionary spirit among its pupils," declared
an early circular, "that they may live for God
<i>and do something</i>."</p>

<p>Always Miss Lyon emphasized the ideal of
an education that should be a training for
service. To this end she decided upon the expedient
of coöperative housework to reduce
running expenses, to develop responsibility,
and to provide healthful physical exercise.
Long before the day of gymnasiums and active
sports, this educator recognized the need of
balanced development of physical as well as
mental habits.</p>

<p>"We need to introduce wise and healthy
ideals not only into our minds, but into our
muscles," she said. "Besides, there is no discipline
so valuable as that which comes from
fitting our labors into the work of others for
a common good."</p>

<p>One difficulty after another was met and vanquished.
When the digging for the foundation
of the first building was actually under way,
quicksand was discovered and another location
had to be chosen. Then it appeared that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
bricks were faulty, which led to another delay.
After the work was resumed and all was
apparently going well, the walls suddenly collapsed.
"Then," said the man in charge, "I
did dread to see Miss Lyon. Now, thought I,
she will be discouraged."</p>

<p>As he hurried towards the ruins, however,
whom should he meet but Miss Lyon herself,
smiling radiantly! "How fortunate it is that
it happened while the men were at breakfast!"
she exclaimed. "I understand that no one
has been injured!"</p>

<p>The corner-stone was laid on a bright
October day that seemed to have turned all
the gray chill of the dying year into a golden
promise of budding life after the time of frost.</p>

<p>"The stones and brick and mortar speak a
language which vibrates through my soul," said
Miss Lyon. "I have indeed lived to see the
time when a body of gentlemen have ventured
to lay the corner-stone of an edifice which will
cost about fifteen thousand dollars&mdash;and for
an institution for women! Surely the Lord
hath remembered our low estate. The work
will not stop with this foundation. Our enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
may have to struggle through embarrassments
for years, but its influence will be felt."</p>

<p>How lovingly she watched the work go on!
When the interior was under way, how carefully
she considered each detail of closets,
shelves, and general arrangements for comfort
and convenience! When the question of
equipment became urgent, how she worked to
create an interest that should express itself
in gifts of bedroom furnishings, curtains,
crockery, and kitchen-ware, as well as books,
desks, chairs, and laboratory material! All
sorts and conditions of contributions and donations
were welcomed. One was reminded of
the way pioneer Harvard was at first supported
by gifts of "a cow or a sheep, corn or
salt, a piece of cloth or of silver plate." Four
months before the day set for the opening, not
a third of the necessary furnishing had come
in.</p>

<p>"Everything that is done for us now," cried
Miss Lyon, "seems like giving bread to the
hungry and cold water to the thirsty!"</p>

<p>On the eighth of November, 1837, the day
that Mount Holyoke opened its door, all was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
excitement in South Hadley. Stages and private
carriages had for two days been arriving
with road-weary, but eager, young women.
The sound of hammers greeted their ears. It
appeared that all the men, young and old, of
the countryside had been pressed into service.
Some were tacking down carpet or matting,
others were carrying trunks, unloading furniture,
and putting up beds. Miss Lyon seemed
to be everywhere, greeting each new-comer
with a word that showed that she already knew
her as an individual, putting the shy and homesick
girls to work, taking a cup of tea to one
who was overtired from her journey, and directing
the placing of furniture and the unpacking
of supplies.</p>

<p>It might well have seemed to those first arrivals
that they must live through a period of
preparation before a reluctant beginning of
regular work could be achieved, but in the midst
of all the noise of house-settling and the fever
of uncompleted entrance examinations the opening
bell sounded on schedule time and classes
began at once. What seemed, at first glance,
hopeless confusion became ordered and stimulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
activity through the generalship and inspiration
of one woman whose watchword was:
"Do the best you can <i>now</i>. Do not lose one
golden opportunity for doing by merely getting
ready to do something. Always remember
that what ought to be done can be done."</p>

<p>This spirit of assured power&mdash;the will to
do&mdash;became the spirit of those who worked
with her, and was in time recognized as "the
Mount Holyoke spirit."</p>

<p>"I can see Miss Lyon now as vividly as if
it were only yesterday that I arrived, tired,
hungry, and fearful, into the strange new world
of the seminary," said a white-haired grandmother,
her spectacles growing misty as she
looked back across the sixty-odd years that
separated her from the experiences that she
was recalling.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you remember most about
her," urged her vivacious granddaughter, a
Mount Holyoke freshman, home for her Christmas
vacation. "Was she really such a wonder
as they all say?"</p>

<p>"Many pictures come to me of Miss Lyon
that are much more vivid than those of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
I saw yesterday," pondered the grandmother.
"But it was, I think, in morning exercises in
seminary hall that she impressed us most.
Those who listened to her earnest words and
looked into her face alight with feeling could
not but remember. Her large blue eyes looked
down upon us as if she held us all in her heart.
What was the secret of her power! My dear,
she <i>was power</i>. All that she taught, she was.
And so while her words awakened, her example&mdash;the
life-giving touch of her life&mdash;gave power
to do and to endure."</p>

<p>The young girl's bright face was turned
thoughtfully towards the fire, but the light that
shone in her eyes was more than the reflected
glow from the cheerful logs. "It is good to
think that a woman can live like that in her
work," she ventured softly.</p>

<p>The grandmother's face showed an answering
glow. "There are some things that cannot
grow old and die," she said. "One of them is
a spirit like Mary Lyon's. When they told us
that she had died, we knew that only her bodily
presence had been removed. She still lived in
our midst&mdash;we heard the ring of her voice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the words we read, in the words our hearts told
us she would say; we even heard the ring of her
laugh! And to-day you may be sure that the
woman-pioneer who had the faith to plant the
first college for women in America, lives by
that faith, not only in her own Mount Holyoke,
but in the larger lives of all the women who
have profited by her labors."</p>

<h2>"THE PRINCESS" OF WELLESLEY</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HIS</span> is the story of a princess of our own
time and our own America&mdash;a princess
who, while little more than a girl herself, was
chosen to rule a kingdom of girls. It is a little
like the story of Tennyson's "Princess," with
her woman's kingdom, and very much like the
happy, old-fashioned fairy-tale.</p>

<p>We have come to think it is only in fairy-tales
that a golden destiny finds out the true,
golden heart, and, even though she masquerades
as a goose-girl, discovers the "kingly
child" and brings her to a waiting throne.
We are tempted to believe that the chance of
birth and the gifts of wealth are the things
that spell opportunity and success. But this
princess was born in a little farm-house, to a
daily round of hard work and plain living.
That it was also a life of high thinking and
rich enjoyment of what each day brought,
proved her indeed a "kingly child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
"Give me health and a day, and I will make
the pomp of emperors ridiculous!" said the
sage of Concord. So it was with little Alice
Freeman. As she picked wild strawberries on
the hills, and climbed the apple-tree to lie for
a blissful minute in a nest of swaying blossoms
under the blue sky, she was, as she said, "happy
all over." The trappings of royalty can add
nothing to one who knows how to be royally
happy in gingham.</p>

<p>But Alice was not always following the pasture
path to her friendly brook, or running
across the fields with the calling wind, or dancing
with her shadow in the barn-yard, where
even the prosy hens stopped pecking corn for a
minute to watch. She had work to do for
Mother. When she was only four, she could
dry the dishes without dropping one; and when
she was six, she could be trusted to keep the
three toddlers younger than herself out of mischief.</p>

<p>"My little daughter is learning to be a real
little mother," said Mrs. Freeman, as she went
about her work of churning and baking without
an anxious thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

  <div class="caption">Alice Freeman Palmer

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
It was Sister Alice who pointed out the
robin's nest, and found funny turtles and baby
toads to play with. She took the little brood
with her to hunt eggs in the barn and to see
the ducks sail around like a fleet of boats on
the pond. When Ella and Fred were wakened
by a fearsome noise at night, they crept up
close to their little mother, who told them a
story about the funny screech-owl in its hollow-tree
home.</p>

<p>"It is the ogre of mice and bats, but not of
little boys and girls," she said.</p>

<p>"It sounds funny now, Alice," they whispered.
"It's all right when we can touch
you."</p>

<p>When Alice was seven a change came in the
home. The father and mother had some serious
talks, and then it was decided that Father
should go away for a time, for two years, to
study to be a doctor.</p>

<p>"It is hard to be chained to one kind of life
when all the time you are sure that you have
powers and possibilities that have never had
a chance to come out in the open," she heard
her father say one evening. "I have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
wanted to be a doctor; I can never be more
than a half-hearted farmer."</p>

<p>"You must go to Albany now, James," said
the dauntless wife. "I can manage the farm
until you get through your course at the medical
college; and then, when you are doing work
into which you can put your whole heart, a better
time must come for all of us."</p>

<p>"How can you possibly get along?" he asked
in amazement. "How can I leave you for two
years to be a farmer, and father and mother,
too?"</p>

<p>"There is a little bank here," she said, taking
down a jar from a high shelf in the cupboard
and jingling its contents merrily. "I have been
saving bit by bit for just this sort of thing.
And Alice will help me," she added, smiling at
the child who had been standing near looking
from father to mother in wide-eyed wonder.
"You will be the little mother while I take
father's place for a time, won't you, Alice?"</p>

<p>"It will be cruelly hard on you all," said the
father, soberly. "I cannot make it seem right."</p>

<p>"Think how much good you can do afterward,"
urged his wife. "The time will go very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
quickly when we are all thinking of that. It is
not hard to endure for a little for the sake of 'a
gude time coming'&mdash;a better time not only for
us, but for many besides. For I know you will
be the true sort of doctor, James."</p>

<p>Alice never quite knew how they did manage
during those two years, but she was quite sure
that work done for the sake of a good to come
is all joy.</p>

<p>"I owe much of what I am to my milkmaid
days," she said.</p>

<p>She was always sorry for children who do not
grow up with the sights and sounds of the country.
"One is very near to all the simple, real
things of life on a farm," she used to say.
"There is a dewy freshness about the early
out-of-door experiences, and a warm wholesomeness
about tasks that are a part of the common
lot. A country child develops, too, a responsibility&mdash;a
power to do and to contrive&mdash;that the
city child, who sees everything come ready to
hand from a near-by store, cannot possibly gain.
However much some of my friends may deplore
my own early struggle with poverty and hard
work, I can heartily echo George Eliot's boast:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"But were another childhood-world my share,</div>
<div class="line">I would be born a little sister there."</div>
</div></div>

<p>When Alice was ten years old, the family
moved from the farm to the village of Windsor,
where Dr. Freeman entered upon his life as a
doctor, and where Alice's real education began.
From the time she was four she had, for varying
periods, sat on a bench in the district school,
but for the most part she had taught herself.
At Windsor Academy she had the advantage of
a school of more than average efficiency.</p>

<p>"Words do not tell what this old school and
place meant to me as a girl," she said years
afterward. "Here we gathered abundant
Greek, Latin, French, and mathematics; here
we were taught truthfulness, to be upright and
honorable; here we had our first loves, our first
ambitions, our first dreams, and some of our
first disappointments. We owe a large debt to
Windsor Academy for the solid groundwork of
education that it laid."</p>

<p>More important than the excellent curriculum
and wholesome associations, however, was the
influence of a friendship with one of the teachers,
a young Harvard graduate who was supporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
himself while preparing for the ministry.
He recognized the rare nature and latent
powers of the girl of fourteen, and taught her
the delights of friendship with Nature and with
books, and the joy of a mind trained to see and
appreciate. He gave her an understanding of
herself, and aroused the ambition, which grew
into a fixed resolve, to go to college. But more
than all, he taught her the value of personal influence.</p>

<p>"It is people that count," she used to say.
"The truth and beauty that are locked up in
books and in nature, to which only a few have
the key, begin really to live when they are made
over into human character. Disembodied ideas
may mean little or nothing; it is when they are
'made flesh' that they can speak to our hearts
and minds."</p>

<p>As Alice drove about with her father when he
went to see his patients and saw how this true
"doctor of the old school" was a physician to
the mind as well as the body of those who
turned to him for help, she came to a further
realization of the truth: It is people that count.</p>

<p>"It must be very depressing to have to associate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
with bodies and their ills all the time,"
she ventured one day when her father seemed
more than usually preoccupied. She never forgot
the light that shone in his eyes as he turned
and looked at her.</p>

<p>"We can't begin to minister to the body until
we understand that spirit is all," he said.
"What we are pleased to call <i>body</i> is but one
expression&mdash;and a most marvelous expression&mdash;of
the hidden life</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="indent10">"that impels</div>
<div class="line">All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</div>
<div class="line">And rolls through all things."</div>
</div></div>

<p>It seemed to Alice that this might be a favorable
time to broach the subject of college. He
looked at her in utter amazement; few girls
thought of wanting more than a secondary education
in those days, and there were still fewer
opportunities for them.</p>

<p>"Why, daughter," he exclaimed, "a little
more Latin and mathematics won't make you a
better home-maker! Why should you set your
heart on this thing?"</p>

<p>"I must go, Father," she answered steadily.
"It is not a sudden notion; I have realized for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a long time that I cannot live my life&mdash;the life
that I feel I have it within me to live&mdash;without
this training. I want to be a teacher&mdash;the best
kind of a teacher&mdash;just as you wanted to be a
doctor."</p>

<p>"But, my dear child," he protested, much
troubled, "it will be as much as we can manage
to see one of you through college, and that one
should be Fred, who will have a family to look
out for one of these days."</p>

<p>"If you let me have this chance, Father," said
Alice, earnestly, "I'll promise that you will
never regret it. I'll help to give Fred his
chance, and see that the girls have the thing
they want as well."</p>

<p>In the end Alice had her way. It seemed as
if the strength of her single-hearted longing had
power to compel a reluctant fate. In June,
1872, when but a little over seventeen, she went
to Ann Arbor to take the entrance examinations
for the University of Michigan, a careful study
of catalogues having convinced her that the
standard of work was higher there than in any
college then open to women.</p>

<p>A disappointment met her at the outset. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
training at Windsor, good as it was, did not
prepare her for the university requirements.
"Conditions" loomed mountain high, and the
examiners recommended that she spend another
year in preparation. Her intelligence and character
had won the interest of President Angell,
however, and he asked that she be granted a
six-weeks' trial. His confidence in her was justified;
for she not only proved her ability to
keep up with her class, but steadily persevered
in her double task until all conditions were removed.</p>

<p>The college years were "a glory instead of a
grind," in spite of the ever-pressing necessity
for strict economy in the use of time and money.
Her sense of values&mdash;"the ability to see large
things large and small things small," which has
been called the best measure of education,&mdash;showed
a wonderful harmony of powers.
While the mind was being stored with knowledge
and the intellect trained to clear, orderly
thinking, there was never a "too-muchness" in
this direction that meant a "not-enoughness"
in the realm of human relationships. Always
she realized that it is people that count, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
supreme test of education as of life was
its "consecrated serviceableness." President
Angell in writing of her said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of her most striking characteristics in college was
her warm and demonstrative sympathy with her circle of
friends. Her soul seemed bubbling over with joy, which
she wished to share with the other girls. While she was
therefore in the most friendly relations with all those girls
then in college, she was the radiant center of a considerable
group whose tastes were congenial with her own.
Without assuming or striving for leadership, she could not
but be to a certain degree a leader among these, some of
whom have attained positions only less conspicuous for
usefulness than her own. Wherever she went, her genial,
outgoing spirit seemed to carry with her an atmosphere
of cheerfulness and joy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the middle of her junior year, news came
from her father of a more than usual financial
stress, owing to a flood along the Susquehanna,
which had swept away his hope of present gain
from a promising stretch of woodland. It
seemed clear to Alice that the time had come
when she must make her way alone. Through
the recommendation of President Angell she
secured a position as teacher of Latin and Greek
in the High School at Ottawa, Illinois, where
she taught for five months, receiving enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
money to carry her through the remainder of
her college course. The omitted junior work
was made up partly during the summer vacation
and partly in connection with the studies
of the senior year. An extract from a letter
home will tell how the busy days went:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the first day of vacation. I have been so busy
this year that it seems good to get a change, even though
I do keep right on here at work. For some time I have
been giving a young man lessons in Greek every Saturday.
I have had two junior speeches already, and there are
still more. Several girls from Flint tried to have me go
home with them for the vacation, but I made up my mind
to stay and do what I could for myself and the other people
here. A young Mr. M. is going to recite to me every
day in Virgil; so with teaching and all the rest I sha'n't
have time to be homesick, though it will seem rather lonely
when the other girls are gone and I don't hear the college
bell for two weeks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Freeman's early teaching showed the
vitalizing spirit that marked all of her relations
with people.</p>

<p>"She had a way of making you feel 'all
dipped in sunshine,'" one of her girls said.</p>

<p>"Everything she taught seemed a part of
herself," another explained. "It wasn't just
something in a book that she had to teach and
you had to learn. She made every page of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
history seem a part of present life and interests.
We saw and felt the things we talked about."</p>

<p>The fame of this young teacher's influence
traveled all the way from Michigan, where she
was principal of the Saginaw High School, to
Massachusetts. Mr. Henry Durant, the founder
of Wellesley, asked her to come to the new
college as teacher of mathematics. She declined
the call, however, and, a year later, a
second and more urgent invitation. Her family
had removed to Saginaw, where Dr. Freeman
was slowly building up a practice, and it would
mean leaving a home that needed her. The one
brother was now in the university; Ella was
soon to be married; and Stella, the youngest,
who was most like Alice in temperament and
tastes, was looking forward hopefully to college.</p>

<p>But at the time when Dr. Freeman was becoming
established and the financial outlook began
to brighten, the darkest days that the family
had ever known were upon them. Stella, the
chief joy and hope of them all, fell seriously ill.
The "little mother" loved this "starlike girl"
as her own child, and looked up to her as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
who would reach heights her feet could never
climb. When she died it seemed to Alice that
she had lost the one chance for a perfectly understanding
and inspiring comradeship that life
offered. At this time a third call came to
Wellesley,&mdash;as head of the department of history,&mdash;and
hoping that a new place with new
problems would give her a fresh hold on joy,
she accepted.</p>

<p>Into her college work the young woman of
twenty-four put all the power and richness of
her radiant personality. She found peace and
happiness in untiring effort, and her girls
found in her the most inspiring teacher they
had ever known. She went to the heart of the
history she taught, and she went to the hearts
of her pupils.</p>

<p>"She seemed to care for each of us&mdash;to find
each as interesting and worth while as if there
were no other person in the world," one of her
students said.</p>

<p>Mr. Durant had longed to find just such a
person to build on the foundation he had laid.
It was in her first year that he pointed her out
to one of the trustees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
"Do you see that little dark-eyed girl? She
will be the next president of Wellesley," he
said.</p>

<p>"Surely she is much too young and inexperienced
for such a responsibility," protested the
other, looking at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"As for the first, it is a fault we easily outgrow,"
said Mr. Durant, dryly, "and as for her
inexperience&mdash;well, I invite you to visit one of
her classes."</p>

<p>The next year, on the death of Mr. Durant,
she was made acting president of the college,
and the year following she inherited the title
and honors, as well as the responsibilities and
opportunities, of the office. The Princess had
come into her kingdom.</p>

<p>The election caused a great stir among the
students, particularly the irrepressible seniors.
It was wonderful and most inspiring that their
splendid Miss Freeman, who was the youngest
member of the faculty, should have won this
honor. "Why, she was only a girl like themselves!
The time of strict observances and tiresome
regulations of every sort was at an end.
Miss Freeman seemed to sense the prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
mood, and, without waiting for a formal assembly,
asked the seniors to meet her in her rooms.
In they poured, overflowing chairs, tables, and
ranging themselves about on the floor in animated,
expectant groups. The new head of the
college looked at them quietly for a minute before
she began to speak.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you seniors," she said at last
seriously, "to ask your advice. You may have
heard that I have been called to the position of
acting president of your college. I am, of
course, too young; and the duties are, as you
know, too heavy for the strongest to carry alone.
If I must manage alone, there is only one course&mdash;to
decline. It has, however, occurred to me
that my seniors might be willing to help by
looking after the order of the college and leaving
me free for administration. Shall I accept?
Shall we work things out together?"</p>

<p>The hearty response made it clear that the
princess was to rule not only by "divine right,"
but also by the glad "consent of the governed."
Perhaps it was her youth and charm and the
romance of her brilliant success that won for
her the affectionate title of "The Princess";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
perhaps it was her undisputed sway in her kingdom
of girls. It was said that her radiant,
"outgoing spirit" was felt in the atmosphere
of the place and in all the graduates. Her spirit
became the Wellesley spirit.</p>

<p>"What did she do besides turning all of you
into an adoring band of Freeman-followers?" a
Wellesley woman was asked.</p>

<p>The reply came without a moment's hesitation:
"She had the life-giving power of a true
creator, one who can entertain a vision of the
ideal, and then work patiently bit by bit to
'carve it in the marble real.' She built the
Wellesley we all know and love, making it practical,
constructive, fine, generous, human, spiritual."</p>

<p>For six years the Princess of Wellesley ruled
her kingdom wisely. She raised the standard
of work, enlisted the interest and support
of those in a position to help, added to the buildings
and equipment, and won the enthusiastic
cooperation of students, faculty, and public.
Then, one day, she voluntarily stepped down
from her throne, leaving others to go on with
the work she had begun. She married Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
George Herbert Palmer of Harvard, and,
(quite in the manner of the fairy-tale) "lived
happily ever after."</p>

<p>"What a disappointment!" some of her
friends said. "That a woman of such unusual
powers and gifts should deliberately leave a
place of large usefulness and influence to shut
herself up in the concerns of a single home!"</p>

<p>"There is nothing better than the making of
a true home," said Alice Freeman Palmer. "I
shall not be shut away from the concerns of
others, but more truly a part of them. 'For
love is fellow-service,' I believe."</p>

<p>The home near Harvard Yard was soon felt
to be the most free and perfect expression of
her generous nature. Its happiness made all
life seem happier. Shy undergraduates and
absorbed students who had withdrawn overmuch
within themselves and their pet problems
found there a thaw after their "winter of discontent."
Wellesley girls&mdash;even in those days
before automobiles&mdash;did not feel fifteen miles
too great a distance to go for a cup of tea and
a half-hour by the fire.</p>

<p>Many were surprised that Mrs. Palmer never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
seemed worn by the unstinted giving of herself
to the demands of others on her time and sympathy.
The reason was that their interests
were her interests. Her spirit was indeed
"outgoing"; there was no wall hedging in a
certain number of things and people as hers,
with the rest of the world outside. As we have
seen, people counted with her supremely; and
the ideas which moved her were those which she
found embodied in the joys and sorrows of human
hearts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer wrote of her days at this time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don't know what will happen if life keeps on growing
so much better and brighter each year. How does your
cup manage to hold so much? Mine is running over, and
I keep getting larger cups; but I can't contain all my
blessings and gladness. We are both so well and busy
that the days are never half long enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>Life held, indeed, a full measure of opportunities
for service. Wellesley claimed her as
a member of its executive committee, and other
colleges sought her counsel. When Chicago
University was founded, she was induced to
serve as its Dean of Women until the opportunities
for girls there were wisely established.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
She worked energetically raising funds for Radcliffe
and her own Wellesley. Throughout the
country her wisdom as an educational expert
was recognized, and her advice sought in matters
of organization and administration. For
several years, as a member of the Massachusetts
State Board of Education, she worked
early and late to improve the efficiency and influence
of the normal schools. She was a public
servant who brought into all her contact with
groups and masses of people the simple directness
and intimate charm that marked her touch
with individuals.</p>

<p>"How is it that you are able to do so much
more than other people?" asked a tired, nervous
woman, who stopped Mrs. Palmer for a word
at the close of one of her lectures.</p>

<p>"Because," she answered, with the sudden
gleam of a smile, "I haven't any nerves nor
any conscience, and my husband says I haven't
any backbone."</p>

<p>It was true that she never worried. She had
early learned to live one day at a time, without
"looking before and after." And nobody knew
better than Mrs. Palmer the renewing power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
joy. She could romp with some of her very
small friends in the half-hour before an important
meeting; go for a long walk or ride along
country lanes when a vexing problem confronted
her; or spend a quiet evening by the fire reading
aloud from one of her favorite poets at the
end of a busy day.</p>

<p>For fifteen years Mrs. Palmer lived this life
of joyful, untiring service. Then, at the time
of her greatest power and usefulness, she died.
The news came as a personal loss to thousands.
Just as Wellesley had mourned her removal to
Cambridge, so a larger world mourned her
earthly passing. But her friends soon found
that it was impossible to grieve or to feel for
a moment that she was dead. The echoes of
her life were living echoes in the world of those
who knew her.</p>

<p>There are many memorials speaking in different
places of her work. In the chapel at
Wellesley, where it seems to gather at every
hour a golden glory of light, is the lovely transparent
marble by Daniel Chester French, eternally
bearing witness to the meaning of her influence
with her girls. In the tower at Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the chimes "make music, joyfully to recall,"
her labors there. But more lasting than marble
or bronze is the living memorial in the hearts
and minds "made better by her presence."
For it is, indeed, people that count, and in the
richer lives of many the enkindling spirit of
Alice Freeman Palmer still lives.</p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF THE RED CROSS</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmin">CHRISTMAS</span> baby! Now isn't that the
best kind of a Christmas gift for us all?"
cried Captain Stephen Barton, who took the
interesting flannel bundle from the nurse's arms
and held it out proudly to the assembled family.</p>

<p>No longed-for heir to a waiting kingdom could
have received a more royal welcome than did
that little girl who appeared at the Barton home
in Oxford, Massachusetts, on Christmas Day,
1821. Ten years had passed since a child had
come to the comfortable farm-house, and the
four big brothers and sisters were very sure that
they could not have had a more precious gift
than this Christmas baby. No one doubted that
she deserved a distinguished name, but it was
due to Sister Dorothy, who was a young lady of
romantic seventeen and something of a reader,
that she was called Clarissa Harlowe, after a
well-known heroine of fiction. The name which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
this heroine of real life actually bore and made
famous, however, was Clara Barton; for the
Christmas baby proved to be a gift not only to
a little group of loving friends, but also to a
great nation and to humanity.</p>

<p>The sisters and brothers were teachers rather
than playmates for Clara, and her education began
so early that she had no recollection of the
way they led her toddling steps through the beginnings
of book-learning. On her first day at
school she announced to the amazed teacher
who tried to put a primer into her hands that
she could spell the "artichoke words." The
teacher had other surprises besides the discovery
that this mite of three was acquainted with
three-syllabled lore.</p>

<p>Brother Stephen, who was a wizard with figures,
had made the sums with which he covered
her slate seem a fascinating sort of play at a
period when most infants are content with
counting the fingers of one hand. All other interests,
however, paled before the stories that
her father told her of great men and their splendid
deeds.</p>

<p>Captain Barton was amused one day at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
discovery that his precocious daughter, who always
eagerly encored his tales of conquerors
and leaders, thought of their greatness in images
of quite literal and realistic bigness. A
president must, for instance, be as large as a
house, and a vice-president as spacious as a
barn door at the very least. But these somewhat
crude conceptions did not put a check on
the epic recitals of the retired officer, who, in
the intervals of active service in plowed fields
or in pastures where his thoroughbreds grazed
with their mettlesome colts, liked to live over
the days when he served under "Mad Anthony"
Wayne in the Revolutionary War, and had a
share in the thrilling adventures of the Western
frontier.</p>

<p>Clara was only five years old when Brother
David taught her to ride. "Learning to ride
is just learning a horse," said this daring youth,
who was the "Buffalo Bill" of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>"How can I learn a horse, David?" quavered
the child, as the high-spirited animals came
whinnying to the pasture bars at her brother's
call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
"Catch hold of his mane, Clara, and just feel
the horse a part of yourself&mdash;the big half for the
time being," said David, as he put her on the
back of a colt that was broken only to bit and
halter, and, easily springing on his favorite, held
the reins of both in one hand, while he steadied
the small sister with the other by seizing hold of
one excited foot.</p>

<p>They went over the fields at a gallop that first
day, and soon little Clara and her mount understood
each other so well that her riding feats
became almost as far-famed as those of her
brother. The time came when her skill and confidence
on horseback&mdash;her power to feel the animal
she rode a part of herself and keep her place
in any sort of saddle through night-long gallops&mdash;meant
the saving of many lives.</p>

<p>David taught her many other practical things
that helped to make her steady and self-reliant
in the face of emergencies. She learned, for instance,
to drive a nail straight, and to tie a knot
that would hold. Eye and hand were trained to
work together with quick decision that made for
readiness and efficiency in dealing with a situation,
whether it meant the packing of a box, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
first-aid measures after an accident on the skating-pond.</p>

<p>She was always an outdoor child, with dogs,
horses, and ducks for playfellows. The fuzzy
ducklings were the best sort of dolls. Sometimes
when wild ducks visited the pond and all
her waddling favorites began to flap their wings
excitedly, it seemed that her young heart felt,
too, the call of large, free spaces.</p>

<p>"The only real fun is to do things," she used
to say.</p>

<p>She rode after the cows, helped in the milking
and churning, and followed her father about,
dropping potatoes in their holes or helping weed
the garden. Once, when the house was being
painted, she begged to be allowed to assist in the
work, even learning to grind the pigments and
mix the colors. The family was at first amused
and then amazed at the persistency of her application
as day after day she donned her apron
and fell to work.</p>

<p>They were not less astonished when she
wanted to learn the work of the weavers in her
brothers' satinet mills. At first, her mother refused
this extraordinary request; but Stephen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
who understood the intensity of her craving to
do things, took her part; and at the end of her
first week at the flying shuttle Clara had the
satisfaction of finding that her cloth was passed
as first-quality goods. Her career as a weaver
was of short duration, however, owing to a fire
which destroyed the mills.</p>

<p>The young girl was as enthusiastic in play as
at work. Whether it was a canter over the
fields on Billy while her dog, Button, dashed
along at her side, his curly white tail bobbing
ecstatically, or a coast down the rolling hills in
winter, she entered into the sport of the moment
with her whole heart.</p>

<p>When there was no outlet for her superabundant
energy, she was genuinely unhappy. Then
it was that a self-consciousness and morbid sensitiveness
became so evident that it was a source
of real concern to her friends.</p>

<p>"People say that I must have been born
brave," said Clara Barton. "Why, I seem to
remember nothing but terrors in my early days.
I was a shrinking little bundle of fears&mdash;fears
of thunder, fears of strange faces, fears of my
strange self." It was only when thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
feeling were merged in the zest of some interesting
activity that she lost her painful shyness
and found herself.</p>

<p>When she was eleven years old she had her
first experience as a nurse. A fall which gave
David a serious blow on the head, together with
the bungling ministrations of doctors, who,
when in doubt, had recourse only to the heroic
treatment of bleeding and leeches, brought the
vigorous young brother to a protracted invalidism.
For two years Clara was his constant and
devoted attendant. She schooled herself to remain
calm, cheerful, and resourceful in the presence
of suffering and exacting demands. When
others gave way to fatigue or "nerves," her
wonderful instinct for action kept her, child
though she was, at her post. Her sympathy expressed
itself in untiring service.</p>

<p>In the years that followed her brother's recovery
Clara became a real problem to herself
and her friends. The old blighting sensitiveness
made her school-days restless and unhappy
in spite of her alert mind and many interests.</p>

<p>At length her mother, at her wit's end because
of this baffling, morbid strain in her remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
daughter, was advised by a man of sane judgment
and considerable understanding of child
nature, to throw responsibility upon her and
give her a school to teach.</p>

<p>It happened, therefore, that when Clara Barton
was fifteen she "put down her skirts, put
up her hair," and entered upon her successful
career as a teacher. She liked the children and
believed in them, entering enthusiastically into
their concerns, and opening the way to new interests.
When asked how she managed the discipline
of the troublesome ones, she said, "The
children give no trouble; I never have to discipline
at all," quite unconscious of the fact
that her vital influence gave her a control that
made assertion of authority unnecessary.</p>

<p>"When the boys found that I was as strong
as they were and could teach them something on
the playground, they thought that perhaps we
might discover together a few other worth-while
things in school hours," she said.</p>

<p>For eighteen years Clara Barton was a
teacher. Always learning herself while teaching
others, she decided in 1852 to enter Clinton
Liberal Institute in New York as a pupil for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
graduation, for there was then no college whose
doors were open to women. When she had all
that the Institute could give her, she looked
about for new fields for effort.</p>

<p>In Bordentown, New Jersey, she found there
was a peculiar need for some one who would
bring to her task pioneer zeal as well as the passion
for teaching. At that time there were no
public schools in the town or, indeed, in the
State.</p>

<p>"The people who pose as respectable are too
proud and too prejudiced to send their boys and
girls to a free pauper school, and in the meantime
all the children run wild," Miss Barton was
told.</p>

<p>"We have tried again and again," said a discouraged
young pedagogue. "It is impossible
to do anything in this place."</p>

<p>"Give me three months, and I will teach
free," said Clara Barton.</p>

<p>This was just the sort of challenge she loved.
There was something to be done. She began
with six unpromising gamins in a dilapidated,
empty building. In a month her quarters
proved too narrow. Each youngster became an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
enthusiastic and effectual advertisement. As
always, her success lay in an understanding of
her pupils as individuals, and a quickening interest
that brought out the latent possibilities of
each. The school of six grew in a year to one
of six hundred, and the thoroughly converted
citizens built an eight-room school-house where
Miss Barton remained as principal and teacher
until a breakdown of her voice made a complete
rest necessary.</p>

<p>The weak throat soon made it evident that
her teaching days were over; but she found at
the same time in Washington, where she had
gone for recuperation, a new work.</p>

<p>"Living is doing," she said. "Even while
we say there is nothing we can do, we stumble
over the opportunities for service that we are
passing by in our tear-blinded self-pity."</p>

<p>The over-sensitive girl had learned her lesson
well. Life offered moment by moment too
many chances for action for a single worker to
turn aside to bemoan his own particular condition.</p>

<p>The retired teacher became a confidential secretary
in the office of the Commissioner of Patents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Great confusion existed in the Patent
Office at that time because some clerks had betrayed
the secrets of certain inventions. Miss
Barton was the first woman to be employed in a
Government department; and while ably handling
the critical situation that called for all her
energy and resourcefulness, she had to cope not
only with the scarcely veiled enmity of those
fellow-workers who were guilty or jealous, but
also with the open antagonism of the rank and
file of the clerks, who were indignant because a
woman had been placed in a position of responsibility
and influence. She endured covert
slander and deliberate disrespect, letting her
character and the quality of her work speak for
themselves. They spoke so eloquently that
when a change in political control caused her
removal, she was before long recalled to
straighten out the tangle that had ensued.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Civil War Miss Barton
was, therefore, at the very storm-center.</p>

<p>The early days of the conflict found her binding
up the wounds of the Massachusetts boys
who had been attacked by a mob while passing
through Baltimore, and who for a time were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
quartered in the Capitol. Some of these recruits
were boys from Miss Barton's own town
who had been her pupils, and all were dear to
her because they were offering their lives for
the Union. We find her with other volunteer
nurses caring for the injured, feeding groups
who gathered about her in the Senate Chamber,
and, from the desk of the President of the Senate,
reading them the home news from the Worcester
papers.</p>

<p>Meeting the needs as they presented themselves
in that time of general panic and distress,
she sent to the Worcester "Spy" appeals for
money and supplies. Other papers took up the
work, and soon Miss Barton had to secure space
in a large warehouse to hold the provisions that
poured in.</p>

<p>Not for many days, however, did she remain
a steward of supplies. When she met the transports
which brought the wounded into the city,
her whole nature revolted at the sight of the
untold suffering and countless deaths which
were resulting from delay in caring for the injured.
Her flaming ardor, her rare executive
ability, and her tireless persistency won for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the confidence of those in command, and, though
it was against all traditions, to say nothing of
iron-clad army regulations, she obtained permission
to go with her stores of food, bandages,
and medicines to the firing-line, where relief
might be given on the battle-field at the time of
direst need. The girl who had been a "bundle
of fears" had grown into the woman who braved
every danger and any suffering to carry help
to her fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>People who spoke of her rare initiative and
practical judgment had little comprehension of
the absolute simplicity and directness of her
methods. She managed the sulky, rebellious
drivers of her army-wagons, who had little respect
for orders that placed a woman in control,
in the same way that she had managed children
in school. Without relaxing her firmness, she
spoke to them courteously, and called them to
share the warm dinner she had prepared and
spread out in appetizing fashion. When, after
clearing away the dishes, she was sitting alone
by the fire, the men returned in an awkward,
self-conscious group.</p>

<p>"We didn't come to get warm," said their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
spokesman, as she kindly moved to make room
for them at the flames, "we come to tell you we
are ashamed. The truth is we didn't want to
come. We know there is fighting ahead, and
we've seen enough of that for men who don't
carry muskets, only whips; and then we've
never seen a train under charge of a woman
before, and we couldn't understand it. We've
been mean and contrary all day, and you've
treated us as if we'd been the general and his
staff, and given us the best meal we've had
in two years. We want to ask your forgiveness,
and we sha'n't trouble you again."</p>

<p>She found that a comfortable bed had been
arranged for her in her ambulance, a lantern
was hanging from the roof, and when next
morning she emerged from her shelter, a steaming
breakfast awaited her and a devoted corps
of assistants stood ready for orders.</p>

<p>"I had cooked my last meal for my drivers,"
said Clara Barton. "These men remained with
me six months through frost and snow and
march and camp and battle; they nursed the
sick, dressed the wounded, soothed the dying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
and buried the dead; and, if possible, they grew
kinder and gentler every day."</p>

<p>An incident that occurred at Antietam is
typical of her quiet efficiency. According to
her directions, the wounded were being fed with
bread and crackers moistened in wine, when one
of her assistants came to report that the entire
supply was exhausted, while many helpless ones
lay on the field unfed. Miss Barton's quick eye
had noted that the boxes from which the wine
was taken had fine Indian meal as packing. Six
large kettles were at once unearthed from the
farm-house in which they had taken quarters,
and soon her men were carrying buckets of hot
gruel for miles over the fields where lay hundreds
of wounded and dying. Suddenly, in the
midst of her labors, Miss Barton came upon the
surgeon in charge sitting alone, gazing at a
small piece of tallow candle which flickered uncertainly
in the middle of the table.</p>

<p>"Tired, Doctor?" she asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Tired indeed!" he replied bitterly; "tired
of such heartless neglect and carelessness.
What am I to do for my thousand wounded men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
with night here and that inch of candle all the
light I have or can get?"</p>

<p>Miss Barton took him by the arm and led
him to the door, where he could see near the
barn scores of lanterns gleaming like stars.</p>

<p>"What is that!" he asked amazedly.</p>

<p>"The barn is lighted," she replied, "and the
house will be directly."</p>

<p>"Where did you get them!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Brought them with me."</p>

<p>"How many have you?"</p>

<p>"All you want&mdash;four boxes."</p>

<p>The surgeon looked at her for a moment as if
he were waking from a dream; and then, as if it
were the only answer he could make, fell to
work. And so it was invariably that she won
her complete command of people as she did of
situations, by always proving herself equal to
the emergency of the moment.</p>

<p>Though, as she said in explaining the tardiness
of a letter, "my hands complain a little
of unaccustomed hardships," she never complained
of any ill, nor allowed any danger or
difficulty to interrupt her work.</p>

<p>"What are my puny ailments beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
agony of our poor shattered boys lying helpless
on the field?" she said. And so, while doctors
and officers wondered at her unlimited capacity
for prompt and effective action, the men
who had felt her sympathetic touch and effectual
aid loved and revered her as "The Angel of
the Battlefield."</p>

<p>One incident well illustrates the characteristic
confidence with which she moved about amid
scenes of terror and panic. At Fredericksburg,
when "every street was a firing-line and
every house a hospital," she was passing along
when she had to step aside to allow a regiment
of infantry to sweep by. At that moment General
Patrick caught sight of her, and, thinking
she was a bewildered resident of the city who
had been left behind in the general exodus,
leaned from his saddle and said reassuringly:</p>

<p>"You are alone and in great danger, madam.
Do you want protection?"</p>

<p>Miss Barton thanked him with a smile, and
said, looking about at the ranks, "I believe I
am the best-protected woman in the United
States."</p>

<p>The soldiers near overheard and cried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
"That's so! that's so!" And the cheer that
they gave was echoed by line after line until a
mighty shout went up as for a victory.</p>

<p>The courtly old general looked about comprehendingly,
and, bowing low, said as he
galloped away, "I believe you are right,
madam."</p>

<p>Clara Barton was present on sixteen battle-fields;
she was eight months at the siege of
Charleston, and served for a considerable period
in the hospitals of Richmond.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;">

  <div class="caption">Clara Barton
</div></div>

<p>When the war was ended and the survivors of
the great armies were marching homeward, her
heart was touched by the distress in many
homes where sons and fathers and brothers
were among those listed as "missing." In all,
there were 80,000 men of whom no definite report
could be given to their friends. She was
assisting President Lincoln in answering the
hundreds of heartbroken letters, imploring
news, which poured in from all over the land
when his tragic death left her alone with the
task. Then, as no funds were available to
finance a thorough investigation of every sort
of record of States, hospitals, prisons, and battle-fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
she maintained out of her own means
a bureau to prosecute the search.</p>

<p>Four years were spent in this great labor,
during which time Miss Barton made many public
addresses, the proceeds of which were devoted
to the cause. One evening in the winter
of 1868, while in the midst of a lecture, her
voice suddenly left her. This was the beginning
of a complete nervous collapse. The hardships
and prolonged strain had, in spite of her
robust constitution and iron will, told at last on
the endurance of that loyal worker.</p>

<p>When able to travel, she went to Geneva,
Switzerland, in the hope of winning back her
health and strength. Soon after her arrival
she was visited by the president and members
of the "International Committee for the Relief
of the Wounded in War," who came to learn
why the United States had refused to sign the
Treaty of Geneva, providing for the relief of
sick and wounded soldiers. Of all the civilized
nations, our great republic alone most unaccountably
held aloof.</p>

<p>Miss Barton at once set herself to learn all
she could about the ideals and methods of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
International Red Cross, and during the Franco-Prussian
War she had abundant opportunity
to see and experience its practical working on
the battle-field.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war in 1870 she was
urged to go as a leader, taking the same part
that she had borne in the Civil War.</p>

<p>"I had not strength to trust for that," said
Clara Barton, "and declined with thanks, promising
to follow in my own time and way; and
I did follow within a week. As I journeyed
on," she continued, "I saw the work of these
Red Cross societies in the field accomplishing
in four months under their systematic organization
what we failed to accomplish in four years
without it&mdash;no mistakes, no needless suffering,
no waste, no confusion, but order, plenty, cleanliness,
and comfort wherever that little flag
made its way&mdash;a whole continent marshaled under
the banner of the Red Cross. As I saw all
this and joined and worked in it, you will not
wonder that I said to myself 'if I live to return
to my country, I will try to make my people
understand the Red Cross and that treaty.'"</p>

<p>Months of service in caring for the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and the helpless victims of siege and famine
were followed by a period of nervous exhaustion
from which she but slowly crept back to
her former hold on health. At last she was
able to return to America to devote herself to
bringing her country into line with the Red
Cross movement. She found that traditionary
prejudice against "entangling alliances with
other powers," together with a singular failure
to comprehend the vital importance of the matter,
militated against the great cause.</p>

<p>"Why should we make provision for the
wounded?" it was said. "We shall never have
another war; we have learned our lesson."</p>

<p>It came to Miss Barton then that the work of
the Red Cross should be extended to disasters,
such as fires, floods, earthquakes, and epidemics&mdash;"great
public calamities which require, like
war, prompt and well-organized help."</p>

<p>Years of devoted missionary work with preoccupied
officials and a heedless, short-sighted
public at length bore fruit. After the Geneva
Treaty received the signature of President
Arthur on March 1, 1882, it was promptly ratified
by the Senate, and the American National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Red Cross came into being, with Clara Barton
as its first president. Through her influence,
too, the International Congress of Berne
adopted the "American Amendment," which
dealt with the extension of the Red Cross to
relief measures in great calamities occurring in
times of peace.</p>

<p>The story of her life from this time on is one
with the story of the work of the Red Cross
during the stress of such disasters as the Mississippi
River floods, the Texas famine in 1885,
the Charleston earthquake in 1886, the Johnstown
flood in 1899, the Russian famine in 1892,
and the Spanish-American War. The prompt,
efficient methods followed in the relief of the
flood sufferers along the Mississippi in 1884
may serve to illustrate the sane, constructive
character of her work.</p>

<p>Supply centers were established, and a
steamer chartered to ply back and forth carrying
help and hope to the distracted human creatures
who stood "wringing their hands on a
frozen, fireless shore&mdash;with every coal-pit filled
with water." For three weeks she patrolled
the river, distributing food, clothing, and fuel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
caring for the sick, and, in order to establish
at once normal conditions of life, providing the
people with many thousands of dollars' worth
of building material, seeds, and farm implements,
thus making it possible for them to help
themselves and in work find a cure for their
benumbing distress.</p>

<p>"Our Lady of the Red Cross" lived past her
ninetieth birthday, but her real life is measured
by deeds, not days. It was truly a long one,
rich in the joy of service. She abundantly
proved the truth of the words: "We gain in
so far as we give. If we would find our life,
we must be willing to lose it."</p>

</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<h2>A MAIDEN CRUSADER</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HERE</span> is no place like a young college
town in a young country for untroubled
optimism. Hope blossoms there as nowhere
else; the ideal ever beckons at the next turn in
the road. When Josiah Willard brought his
little family to Oberlin, it seemed to them all
that a new golden age of opportunity was theirs.
Even Frances, who was little more than a baby,
drank in the spirit of the place with the air she
breathed.</p>

<p>It was not hard to believe in a golden age
when one happened to see little Frances, or
"Frank," Willard dancing like a sunbeam about
the campus. She liked to play about the big
buildings, where father went every day with his
big books, and watch for him to come out.
Sometimes one of the students would stop to
speak to her; sometimes a group would gather
about while, with fair hair flying and small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
arms waving, in a voice incredibly clear and
bird-like, she "said a piece" that mother had
taught her.</p>

<p>"Is that a little professorling?" asked a new-comer
one day, attracted by the child's cherub
face and darting, fairylike ways.</p>

<p>"Guess again!" returned a dignified senior.
"Her father is one of the students. Haven't
you noticed that fine-looking Willard? The
mother, too, knows how to appreciate a college,
I understand&mdash;used to be a teacher back in New
York where they came from."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that this happy little
goldfinch is the child of two such solemn owls!"
exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort. They are very wide-awake,
alive sort of people, I assure you,&mdash;the
kind who'd make a success of anything. The
father wants to be a preacher, they say&mdash;wait,
there he comes now!"</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that Mr. Willard was
an alert, capable man and a good father. The
little girl ran to him with a joyful cry, and a
sturdy lad who had been trying to climb a tree
bounded forward at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
"I trust that my small fry haven't been making
trouble," said the man, giving his free hand
to Frances and graciously allowing Oliver to
carry two of his armful of books.</p>

<p>"Only making friends," the senior responded
genially, "and one can see that they can't very
well help that."</p>

<p>The Oberlin years were a happy, friendly
time for all the family. While both father and
mother were working hard to make the most of
their long-delayed opportunity for a liberal education,
they delighted above all in the companionship
of neighbors with tastes like their
own. After five years, however, it became
clear that the future was not to be after their
planning. Mr. Willard's health failed, and a
wise doctor said that he must leave his book-world,
and take up a free, active life in the open.
So the little family joined the army of westward-moving
pioneers.</p>

<p>Can you picture the three prairie-schooners
that carried them and all their goods to the new
home? The father drove the first, Oliver geehawed
proudly from the high perch of the next,
and mother sat in the third, with Frances and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
little sister Mary on a cushioned throne made
out of father's topsyturvy desk. For nearly
thirty days the little caravan made its way&mdash;now
through forests, now across great sweeping
prairies, now over bumping corduroy roads
that crossed stretches of swampy ground.
They cooked their bacon and potatoes, gypsy-fashion,
on the ground, and slept under the
white hoods of their long wagons, when they
were not kept awake by the howling of wolves.</p>

<p>When Sunday came, they rested wherever the
day found them&mdash;sometimes on the rolling
prairie, where their only shelter from rain and
sun was the homely schooner, but where at
night they could look up at the great tent of the
starry heavens; sometimes in the cathedral of
the forest, where they found Jack-in-the-pulpit
preaching to the other wild-flowers and birds
and breezes singing an anthem of praise.</p>

  Frances E. Willard
</div></div>

<p>It was truly a new world through which they
made their way&mdash;beginnings all about&mdash;the
roughest, crudest sort of beginnings, glorified
by the brightest hopes. Tiny cabins were
planted on the edge of the prairies; rough huts
of logs were dropped down in clearings in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
forest. Everywhere people were working with
an energy that could not be daunted&mdash;felling
trees, sowing, harvesting, building. As they
passed by the end of Lake Michigan they caught
a glimpse of a small, struggling village in the
midst of a dark, hopeless-looking morass, from
which they turned aside on seeing the warning
sign <i>No bottom here</i>. That little settlement in
the swamp was Chicago.</p>

<p>Northward they journeyed to Wisconsin,
where on the bluffs above Rock River, not far
from Janesville, they found a spot with fertile
prairie on one side and sheltering, wooded hills
on the other. It seemed as if the place fairly
called to them: "This is home. You are my
people. My fields and hills and river have been
waiting many a year just for you!"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Willard planted the roof-tree, using
timber that his own ax had wrested from the
forest. Year by year it grew with their life.
"Forest Home," as they lovingly called it, was
a low, rambling dwelling, covered with trailing
vines and all but hidden away in a grove of
oaks and evergreens. It seemed as if Nature
had taken over the work of their hands&mdash;house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
barns, fields, and orchards&mdash;and made them her
dearest care. Here were people after her own
heart, people who went out eagerly to meet and
use the things that each day brought. They
found real zest in plowing fields, laying fences,
raising cattle, and learning the ways of soil and
weather. They learned how to keep rats and
gophers from devouring their crops, how to
bank up the house as a protection from hurricanes,
and how to fight the prairie fires with
fire.</p>

<p>Frank Willard grew as the trees grew, quite
naturally, gathering strength from the life
about her. She had her share in the daily
tasks; she had, too, a chance for free, happy,
good times. There was but one other family of
children near enough to share their plays, but
the fun was never dependent on numbers or
novelty. If there were only two members of
the "Rustic Club" present, the birds and chipmunks
and other wood-creatures supplied every
lack. Sometimes when they found themselves
longing to "pick up and move back among
folks," they played that the farm was a city.</p>

<p>"'My mind to me a kingdom is,'" quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Frank, optimistically; "and I think if we all
put our minds to it, we can manage to people
this spot on the map very sociably."</p>

<p>Their city had a model government, and ideal
regulations for community health and enjoyment.
It had also an enterprising newspaper
of which Frank was editor.</p>

<p>Frank was the leader in all of the fun. She
was the commanding general in that famous
"Indian fight" when, with Mary and Mother,
she held the fort against the attack of two dreadful,
make-believe savages and a dog. It was
due to her strategy that the dog was brought
over to their side by an enticing sparerib and
the day won. Frank, too, was the captain of
their good ship <i class="ship">Enterprise</i>.</p>

<p>"If we do live inland, we don't have to <i>think
inland</i>, Mary," she said. "What's the use of
sitting here in Wisconsin and sighing because
we've never seen the ocean. Let's take this
hen-coop and go a-sailing. Who knows what
magic shores we'll touch beyond our Sea of
Fancy!"</p>

<p>A plank was put across the pointed top of the
hen-coop, and the children stood at opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
ends steering, slowly when the sea was calm
and more energetically when a storm was brewing.
The hens clucked and the chickens ran
about in a panic, but the captain calmly charted
the waters and laid down rules of navigation.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, the best times of all were
those that Frank spent in her retreat at the top
of a black oak tree, where she could sit weaving
stories of bright romance to her heart's content.
On the tree she nailed a sign with this painted
warning: "The Eagle's Nest. Beware!" to
secure her against intruders. Here she wrote
a wonderful novel of adventure, some four hundred
pages long.</p>

<p>But this eagle found that the wings of her
imagination could not make her entirely free
and happy. She had to return from the heights
and the high adventures of her favorite heroes
to the dull routine of farm life. She was not
even allowed to ride, as Oliver was.</p>

<p>"Well, if I can't be trusted to manage a horse,
I'll see what can be done with a cow and a
saddle. I simply must ride <i>something</i>," Frank
declared, with a determined toss of her head.</p>

<p>It took not only determination, but also grim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
endurance and a sense of fun to help her through
this novel experiment, which certainly had in
it more excitement than pleasure. However,
when her father saw her ride by on her long-horned
steed, he said with a laugh:</p>

<p>"You have fairly earned a better mount,
Frank. And I suppose there is really no more
risk of your breaking your neck with a horse."</p>

<p>That night Frank wrote in her journal:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! rejoice! A new era has this moment
been ushered in. Rode a horse through
the corn&mdash;the acme of my hopes realized."</p>

<p>In the saddle, with the keen breath of a brisk
morning in her face, she felt almost free&mdash;almost
a part of the larger life for which she
longed. "I think I'm fonder of anything out
of my sphere than anything in it," she said to
her mother, whose understanding and sympathy
never failed her.</p>

<p>Perhaps she loved especially to pore over a
book of astronomy and try to puzzle out the
starry paths on the vast prairie of the heavens,
because it carried her up and away from her
every-day world. Sometimes, however, she was
brought back to earth with a rude bump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
"When I had to get dinner one Sunday, I
fairly cried," she said. "To come back to frying
onions, when I've been among the rings of
Saturn, is terrible."</p>

<p>She didn't at all know what it was for which
she longed. Only she knew that she didn't
want to grow up&mdash;to twist up her free curls
with spiky hair-pins and to wear long skirts
which seemed to make it plain that a weary
round of shut-in tasks was all her lot and that
the happy days of roaming woods and fields
were over.</p>

<p>Through all the girlhood days at "Forest
Home" Frank longed for the chance to go to
a real school as much as she longed to be free.
Oliver went to the Janesville Academy, and
later to Beloit College, but she could get only
fleeting glimpses of his more satisfying life
through the books he brought home and his
talks of lectures and professors. She remembered
those far-off days at Oberlin as a golden
time indeed. There even a girl might have the
chance to learn the things that would set her
mind and soul free.</p>

<p>It was a great day for Frances and Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Willard when Mr. Hodge, a Yale man who was,
like her father, exiled to a life in a new country,
decided to open a school for the children of the
neighboring farms. On the never-to-be-forgotten
first day the girls got up long before light,
put their tin pails of dinner and their satchels
of books with their coats, hoods, and mufflers,
and then stood watching the clock, whose provokingly
measured ticks seemed entirely indifferent
to the eager beating of their hearts. At
last the hired man yoked the oxen to the long
"bob-sled," and Oliver drove them over a new
white road to the new school. The doors were
not yet open.</p>

<p>"I told you it was much too early," said
Oliver. "The idea of being so crazy over the
opening of a little two-by-four school like this!"</p>

<p>"It does look like a sort of big ground-nut,"
said Frank, with a laugh, "but it's ours to
crack. Besides, we have a Yale graduate to
teach us, and Beloit can't beat that!"</p>

<p>"Let's go over to Mr. Hodge's for the key,
and make the fire for him," suggested Mary.</p>

<p>There was an unusually long entry in Frank's
diary that night:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>At last Professor Hodge appeared, in his long-tailed
blue coat with brass buttons, carrying an armful of school-books
and a dinner-bell in his hand. He stood on the
steps and rang the bell, long, loud, and merrily. My
heart bounded, and I said inside of it, so that nobody
heard: "At last we are going to school all by ourselves,
Mary and I, and we are going to have advantages like
other folks, just as Mother said we should." O! goody-goody-goody!
I feel satisfied with the world, myself, and
the rest of mankind.</p></blockquote>

<p>This enthusiasm for school and study did not
wane as the days went by. "I want to know
everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>," Frank would declare
vehemently. "It is only <i>knowing</i> that can make
one free."</p>

<p>The time came when she was to go away
to college. Wistfully she went about saying
good-by to all the pleasant haunts about "Forest
Home." For a long time she sat on her old
perch in the "Eagle's nest," looking off towards
the river and the hills.</p>

<p>"I think that as I know more, I live more,"
said Frank to her mother that night. "I am
alive to so many things now that I never thought
of six months ago; and everything is dearer&mdash;is
more a part of myself."</p>

<p>The North-West Female College, at Evanston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Illinois, was Frank's alma mater. Here
her love of learning made her a leader in all
her classes; and her originality, daring, and
personal charm made her a leader in the social
life of the students. She was editor of the college
paper, and first fun-maker of a lively clan
whose chief delight it was to shock some of their
meek classmates out of their unthinking
"goody-goodness." She was known, for instance,
to have climbed into the steeple and to
have remained on her giddy perch during an
entire recitation period in the higher mathematics.</p>

<p>In her days of teaching, Frank was the same
alert, free, eager-minded, fun-loving girl. First
in a country school near Chicago, and afterward
in a seminary in Pittsburg, she was a successful
teacher because she never ceased to be a learner.</p>

<p>"Frank, you have the <i>hungriest</i> soul I ever
saw in a human being. It will never be satisfied!"
said one of her friends.</p>

<p>"I shall never be satisfied until I have entered
every open door, and I shall not go in alone,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>In all of her pursuit of knowledge and culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
she was intensely social. She was always
learning with others and for others. A bit
from her diary in 1866 reveals the spirit in
which she worked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I read a good deal and learn ever so many new things
every day. I get so hungry to know things. I'll teach
these girls as well as possible.... Girls, girls, girls!
Questions upon questions. Dear me, it is no small undertaking
to be elder sister to the whole 180 of them. They
treat me beautifully, and I think I reciprocate.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Miss Willard seems to see us not as we are,
but as we hope we are becoming," one of her
girls said. "And so we simply <i>have</i> to do what
she believes we can do."</p>

<p>No one was a stranger or indifferent to her.
When her clear blue eyes looked into the eyes
of another, they always saw a friend.</p>

<p>Through these early years of teaching
Frances Willard was learning not only from
constant study and work with others, but also
from sorrow. Her sister Mary was taken
from her. The story of what her gentle life
and loving comradeship meant to Frank is told
in the first and best of Miss Willard's books,
"Nineteen Beautiful Years," which gives many
delightful glimpses of their childhood on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Wisconsin farm and the school-girl years together.
Soon after Mary's death "Forest
Home" was sold and the family separated.
Frank wrote in her journal at this time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am to lose sight of the old familiar landmarks; old
things are passing from me, whose love is for old things.
I am pushing out all by myself into the wide, wide sea.</p></blockquote>

<p>The writing of the story of Mary's life, together
with essays and articles of general interest
for the papers and magazines, "took the
harm out of life for a while." In all her writing,
as in her teaching and later in her public
speaking, her instinctive faith in people was the
secret of her power and influence as a leader.</p>

<p>"For myself, I liked the world, believed it
friendly, and could see no reason why I might
not confide in it," she said.</p>

<p>When another sorrow, the loss of her father,
threatened to darken her life for a time, a friend
came to the rescue and "opened a new door"
for her&mdash;the door of travel and study abroad.
They lived for two and a half years in Europe,
and made a journey to Syria and Egypt. During
much of this time Miss Willard spent nine
hours a day in study. She longed to make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
own the impressions of beauty and the haunting
charm of the past.</p>

<p>"I must really enter into the life of each
place," she said, "if it is only for a few weeks
or months. I want to feel that I have a right
to the landscape&mdash;that I'm not just an intruding
tourist, caring only for random sight-seeing."</p>

<p>But Miss Willard brought back much more
than a general culture gained through a study
of art, history, and literature, and a contact
with civilization. She gained, above all, a vital
interest in conditions of life, particularly those
that concern women and their opportunities for
education, self-expression, and service. The
Frances E. Willard that the world knows, the
organizer and leader in social reform, was born
at this time. On her thirtieth birthday she
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can <i>do</i> so much more when I go home. I shall have a
hold on life, and a fitness for it so much more assured.
Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;there may be noble, wide-reaching
work for me in the years ahead.</p></blockquote>

<p>It seemed to Miss Willard, when she returned
to her own country, that there was, after all, no
land like America, and no spot anywhere so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
truly satisfying as Rest Cottage in Evanston,
where her mother awaited her home-coming. A
signal honor awaited her as well. She was
called to be president of her alma mater; and
when the college became a part of the North-Western
University, she remained as Dean of
Women.</p>

<p>At this time many towns and cities of the
Middle West were the scene of a strange, pathetic,
and heart-stirring movement known as
the Temperance Crusade. Gentle, home-loving
women, white-haired mothers bent with toil and
grief, marched through the streets, singing
hymns, praying, and making direct appeals to
keepers of saloons "for the sake of humanity
and their own souls' sake to quit their soul-destroying
business." Their very weakness
was their strength. Their simple faith and the
things they had suffered through the drink evil
pleaded for them. A great religious revival
was under way.</p>

<p>In Chicago a band of women who were marching
to the City Council to ask that the law for
Sunday closing of saloons be enforced were
rudely jostled and insulted by a mob. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Willard, who had before been deeply stirred by
the movement, was now thoroughly aroused.
She made several eloquent speeches in behalf
of the cause, which was, she said, "everybody's
war." Her first instinct was to leave her college
and give her all to the work. Then it
seemed to her that she ought to help just where
she was&mdash;that everybody ought. So, just where
she was, the young dean devoted her power of
eloquent speech and her influence with people to
the cause. Day by day her interest in reform
became more absorbing. She realized that the
early fervor and enthusiasm of the movement
needed to be strengthened by "sober second
thought" and sound organization.</p>

<p>"If I only had more time&mdash;if I were more
free!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then the turn of events did indeed free her
from her responsibility to her college. A
change of policy so altered the conditions of
her work that she decided to resign her charge
and go east to study the temperance movement.
The time came when she had to make a final
choice. Two letters reached her on the same
day: One asked her to assume the principal-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>ship
of an important school in New York at a
large salary; the other begged her to take
charge of the Chicago branch of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union at no salary at
all. The girl who had worshiped culture and
lived in books decided to accept the second call;
and turning her back on a brilliant career and
worldly success, she threw in her lot with the
most unpopular reform of the day. Frances
Willard, the distinguished teacher, writer, and
lecturer, became a crusader.</p>

<p>"How can you think it right to give up your
interest in literature and art!" wailed one of
her friends and admirers.</p>

<p>"What greater art than to try to restore the
image of God to faces that have lost it?" replied
Miss Willard.</p>

<p>Those early days in Chicago were a brave,
splendid time. Often walking miles, because
she had no money for car-fare, the inspired crusader
"followed the gleam" of her vision of
what this woman's movement might accomplish.
Where others saw only an uncertain group of
overwrought fanatics, she saw an organized
army of earnest workers possessed of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
"loftiest chivalry which comes as a sequel of
their service to the weakest."</p>

<p>"I seemed to see the end from the beginning,"
she said; "and when one has done that,
nothing can discourage or daunt."</p>

<p>Miss Willard often said that she was never
happier than during this time, when her spirit
was entirely free, because she neither longed
for what the world could give nor feared what
it might take away. She felt very near to the
poor people among whom she worked.</p>

<p>"I am a better friend than you dream," she
would say in her heart, while her eyes spoke her
sympathy and understanding. "I know more
about you than you think, for I am hungry,
too."</p>

<p>Of course, in time, the women discovered that
their valued leader did not have an independent
income as they had imagined (since she had
never seemed to give a thought to ways and
means for herself), and a sufficient salary was
provided for her. But always she spent her
income as she spent herself&mdash;to the utmost for
the work.</p>

<p>The secret of Miss Willard's success as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
speaker lay in this entire giving of herself.
The intensity of life, the irrepressible humor,
the never-failing sympathy, the spirit that hungered
after all that was beautiful shone in her
clear eyes, and, in the pure, vibrant tones of
her wonderful voice, went straight to the hearts
of all who listened. She did not enter into her
life as a crusader halt and maimed; all of the
woman's varied interests and capacities were
felt in the work of the reformer.</p>

<p>"She is a great orator because in her words
the clear seeing of a perfectly poised mind and
the warm feeling of an intensely sympathetic
heart are wonderfully blended," said Henry
Ward Beecher.</p>

<p>Miss Willard was not only a gifted speaker,
whose pure, flame-like spirit enkindled faith and
enthusiasm in others; she was also a rare organizer
and indefatigable worker. As president
of the National Union, she visited nearly
every city and town in the United States, and,
during a dozen years, averaged one meeting a
day. The hours spent on trains were devoted
to making plans and preparing addresses. On
a trip up the Hudson, while everybody was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
deck enjoying the scenery, Miss Willard remained
in the cabin busy with pad and pencil.</p>

<p>"I know myself too well to venture out," she
said to a friend who remonstrated with her.
"There is work that must be done."</p>

<p>Under Miss Willard's leadership the work
became a power in the life and progress of the
nation and of humanity. There were those
who objected the very breadth and inclusiveness
of her sympathies and interests, and who
protested against the "scatteration" policies,
that would, they said, lead to no definite goal.</p>

<p>"I cannot see why any society should impose
limitations on any good work," said this broad-minded
leader. "Everything is not in the temperance
movement, but the temperance movement
should be in everything."</p>

<p>In 1898 the loyal crusader was called to lay
down her arms and leave the battle to others.
She had given so unstintedly to every good
work all that she was, that at fifty-eight her
powers of endurance were spent. "I am so
tired&mdash;so tired," she said again and again; and
at the last, with a serene smile, "How beautiful
it is to be with God!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
In the great hall of the Capitol, where each
State has been permitted to place statues of two
of its most cherished leaders, Illinois has put
the marble figure of Frances E. Willard, the
only woman in a company of soldiers and statesmen.
In presenting the statue to the nation,
Mr. Foss, who represented Miss Willard's own
district in Illinois, closed his address with these
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Frances E. Willard once said: "If I were asked what
was the true mission of the ideal woman, I would say, 'It
is to make the whole world home-like.'" Illinois, therefore,
presents this statue not only as a tribute to her whom
it represents,&mdash;one of the foremost women of America,&mdash;but
as a tribute to woman and her mighty influence upon
our national life; to woman in the home; to woman wherever
she is toiling for the good of humanity; to woman
everywhere who has ever stood "For God, for home, for
native land."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<h2>THE SINGER OF A NATION'S SONG</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">WO</span> little girls were rolling hoops along
the street when they suddenly caught
them over their little bare arms and drew up
close to the railings of a house on the corner.</p>

<p>"There is the wonderful coach and the little
girl I told you about, Eliza," whispered Marietta,
pushing back the straw bonnet that shaded
her face from the sun and pointing with her
stick.</p>

<p>It was truly a magnificent yellow coach, pulled
by two proud gray horses. Even Cinderella's
golden equipage could not have been more splendid.
Moreover, the little girl who sat perched
upon the bright-blue cushioned seat wore an
elegant blue pelisse, that just matched the heavenly
color of the lining, and a yellow-satin bonnet
that was clearly inspired by the straw-colored
outer shell of the chariot itself. The fair
chubby face under the satin halo was turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
toward the children, and a pair of clear gray
eyes regarded them with eager interest.</p>

<p>"She looked as if she wanted to speak!" said
Marietta, breathlessly. "Oh, Eliza, did you
ever see any one so beautiful? Just like a doll
or a fairy-tale princess!"</p>

<p>"Huh!" cried Eliza, the scornful; "didn't
you see that she has red hair? Who ever heard
of a doll or a princess with red hair?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a witch or a bad fairy turned her
spun-gold locks red for spite," suggested Marietta.
"Anyway, I wouldn't mind red hair if
I was in her place&mdash;so rich and all. Wouldn't
it be grand to ride in a fine coach and have
everything you want even before you stop to
wish for it!"</p>

<p>How astonished Marietta would have been if
she could have known that the little lady in the
chariot was wishing that she were a little girl
with a hoop! For even when she was very
small Julia Ward had other trials besides the
red hair. Nowadays, people realize that red-gold
hair is a true "crowning glory," but it
wasn't the style to like it in 1825, at the time
this story begins. So little Julia's mother tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
her best to tone down the bright color with
sobering washes and leaden combs. One day,
however, the child heard a visitor say, "Your
little girl is very beautiful; her hair is pretty,
too, with that lovely complexion."</p>

<p>Eagerly Julia climbed upon a chair and then
on the high, old-fashioned dressing-table, so that
she could gaze in the mirror to her heart's content.
"Is that all?" she cried after a moment,
and scrambled down, greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>Eliza and Marietta would have been truly
amazed if they had known that the little queen
of the splendid coach had very little chance for
the good times that a child loves. In these days
I really believe that people would pity her and
say, "Poor little rich girl!" She was brought
up with the greatest strictness. There were
many lessons,&mdash;French, Latin, music, and dancing&mdash;for
she must have an education that would
fit her to shine in her high station. When she
went out for an airing, it was always in the big
coach, "like a little lady." There was never
a chance for a hop-skip-and-jump play-hour.
Her delicate cambric dresses and kid slippers
were only suited to sedate indoor ways, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
even when she was taken to the sea-shore for a
holiday, her face was covered with a thick green
veil to keep her fair skin from all spot and
blemish. Dignity and Duty were the guardian
geniuses of Julia Ward's childhood.</p>

<p>Her father, Samuel Ward, was a rich New
York banker, with a fine American sense of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">noblesse oblige</i>. He believed that a man's
wealth and influence spell strict accountability
to his country and to God, and he lived according
to that belief. He believed that as a banker
his most vital concern was not to make himself
richer and richer, but to manage money matters
in such a way as to serve his city and the
nation as a whole. In those times of financial
stress which came to America in the early part
of the nineteenth century, his heroic efforts
more than once enabled his bank to weather a
financial storm and uphold the credit of the
State. On one occasion his loyalty and unflagging
zeal secured a loan of five million dollars
from the Bank of England in the nick of
time to avert disaster.</p>

<p>"Julia," cried her brother, who had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
come in from Wall Street, "men have been going
up and down the office stairs all day long,
carrying little wooden kegs of gold on their
backs, marked 'Prime, Ward &amp; King' and filled
with English gold!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ward, however, did not see the triumphal
procession of the kegs; he was prostrated
by a severe illness, due, it was said, to
his too exacting labors. Years afterward, Mr.
Ward's daughter said that her best inheritance
from the old firm was the fact that her father
had procured this loan which saved the honor
of the Empire State.</p>

<p>"From the time I was a tiny child," said
Julia Ward, "I had heard stories of my ancestors&mdash;colonial
governors and officers in the
Revolution, among whom were numbered General
Nathanael Greene and General Marion, the
'Swamp Fox' whose 'fortress was the good
green wood,' whose 'tent the cypress-tree.'
When I thought of the brave and honorable men
and the fair and prudent wives and daughters
of the line, they seemed to pass before my unworthy
self 'terrible as an army with banners'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>&mdash;but
there was, too, the trumpet-call of inspiration
in the thought that they were truly
mine own people."</p>

<p>If a sense of duty and the trumpet-call of her
forebears urged little Julia on to application in
her early years, she soon learned to love study
for its own sake. When, at nine years of age,
she began to attend school, she listened to such
purpose to the recitations of a class in Italian
that she presently handed to the astonished
principal a letter correctly written in that language,
begging to be admitted to the study of
the tongue whose soft musical vowels had
charmed her ear. She had not only aptitude,
but genuine fondness, for languages, and early
tried various experiments in the use of her own.
When a child of ten she began to write verse,
and thereafter the expression of her thoughts
and feelings in poetic form was as natural as
breathing.</p>

<p>If you could have seen some of the solemn
verses entitled, "All things shall pass," and,
"We return no more," written by the child not
yet in her teens, you might have said, "What
an extraordinary little girl! Has she always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
been ill, or has she never had a chance for a
good time?"</p>

<p>It was certainly true that life seemed a very
serious thing to the child. Her eyes were continually
turned inward, for they had not
been taught to discover and enjoy the things of
interest and delight in the real world. New
York was in that interesting stage of its growth
that followed upon the opening of the Erie
Canal. Not yet a city of foreigners,&mdash;the melting-pot
of all nations,&mdash;the commercial opportunities
which better communication with the
Great Lakes section gave caused unparalleled
prosperity. In 1835 the metropolis had a population
of 200,000; but Broadway was still in
large part a street of dignified brick residences
with bright green blinds and brass knockers,
along which little girls could roll their hoops.
Canal Street was a popular boulevard, with a
canal bordered by trees running through the
center and a driveway on either side; and the
district neighboring on the Battery and Castle
Garden was still a place of wealth and fashion.</p>

<p>It is to be doubted, however, if Julia Ward
ever saw anything on her drives to call her out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of her day-dreaming self. Nor had she eyes
for the marvels of nature. The larkspurs and
laburnums in the garden had no language that
she could understand. "I grew up," she said,
"with the city measure of the universe&mdash;my own
house, somebody else's, the trees in the park,
a strip of blue sky overhead, and a great deal
about nature read from the best authors, most
of which meant nothing at all. Years later I
learned to enjoy the drowsy murmur of green
fields in midsummer, the song of birds and the
ways of shy wood-flowers, when my own children
opened the door into that 'mighty world
of eye and ear.'"</p>

<p>When Julia was sixteen, the return of her
brother from Germany opened a new door of
existence to her. She had just left school and
had begun to study in real earnest. So serious
was she in her devotion to her self-imposed
tasks that she sometimes bade a maid tie her
in a chair for a certain period. Thus, in bonds,
with a mind set free from all temptation to
roam, she wrestled with the difficulties of German
grammar and came off victorious. But
Brother Sam led her to an appreciation of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
besides the poetry of Schiller and Goethe.
He had a keen and wholesome enjoyment of
the world of people, and in the end succeeded
in giving his young sister a taste of natural
youthful gaiety.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Samuel, Junior, to his father one
evening, "you do not keep in view the importance
of the social tie."</p>

<p>"The social what?" asked the amazed Puritan.</p>

<p>"The social tie, sir."</p>

<p>"I make small account of that," rejoined the
father, coldly.</p>

<p>"I will die in defense of it!" retorted the
son, hotly.</p>

<p>The young man found, however, that it was
more agreeable to live for the social tie than to
die for it. And Julia, beginning to long for
something besides family evenings with books
and music varied by an occasional lecture or a
visit to the house of an uncle, seemed to herself
"like a young damsel of olden times, shut up
within an enchanted castle." When she was
nineteen she decided upon a declaration of independence.
If she could only muster the courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
to meet her affectionate jailer face to face,
she thought that the bars of his prejudice
against fashionable society must surely fall.</p>

<p>"I am going to give a party&mdash;<i>a party of my
very own</i>," she announced to her brothers;
"and you must help me with the list of guests."</p>

<p>Having obtained her father's permission to
invite a few friends "to spend the evening,"
she set about her preparations. This first
party of her young life should, she resolved, be
correct in every detail. The best caterer in
New York was engaged, and a popular group of
musicians. She even introduced a splendid cut-glass
chandelier to supplement the conservative
lighting of the drawing-room. "My first party
must be a brilliant success," she said, with a
smile and a determined tilt of her chin.</p>

<p>A brilliant company was gathered to do the
débutante honor on the occasion of her audacious
entrance into society. Mr. Ward showed
no surprise, however, when he descended the
stairs and appeared upon the festive scene.
He greeted the guests courteously and watched
the dancing without apparent displeasure.
Julia, herself, betrayed no more excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
than seemed natural to the acknowledged belle
of the evening, but her heart was beating in a
fashion not quite in tune with the music of the
fiddles. When the last guest had departed she
went, according to custom, to bid her father
good night. And now came the greatest surprise
of all! Mr. Ward took the young girl's
hand in his. "My daughter," he said with
tender gravity, "I was surprised to see that
your idea of 'a few friends' differed widely
from mine. After this you need not hesitate to
consult me freely and frankly about what you
want to do." Then, kissing her good night with
his usual affection, he dismissed the subject forever.</p>

<p>Julia's brief skirmish for independence
proved not a rebellion, but a revolution. Her
brother's marriage to Miss Emily Astor introduced
an era of gaiety at this time; and when
the young girl had once fairly taken her place
in society, there was no such thing as going
back to the old life. "Jolie Julie," as she was
lovingly called in the home-circle, became a
reigning favorite. Even rumors of her amazing
blue-stocking tendencies could not spoil her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
success. It was whispered that she was given
to quoting German philosophy and French
poetry. "I believe she dreams in Italian,"
vowed one greatly awed damsel.</p>

<p>However that might be, "Jolie Julie" certainly
had a place in the dreams of many. Her
beauty and charm won all hearts. The bright
hair was now an acknowledged glory above the
apple-blossom fairness of her youthful bloom.
But it was not alone the loveliness of the delicately
molded features and the tender brightness
of the clear gray eyes that made her a success.
Notwithstanding the early neglect of
"the social tie," it was soon plain that she had
the unfailing tact, the ready wit, and native
good humor that are the chief assets of the
social leader who is "born to the purple." Besides,
Miss Ward's unusual acquirements could
be turned so as to masquerade, in their rosy
linings, as accomplishments. Her musical gifts
were not reserved for hours of solitary musing,
but were freely devoted to the pleasure of her
friends; and even the lofty poetic Muse could on
occasion indulge in a comic gambol to the great
delight of her intimates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Miss Ward soon tried her wings in other
spheres beyond New York. She found a ready
welcome in Boston's select inner circle, where
she made the acquaintance of Longfellow,
Emerson, Whittier, Holmes, and other leading
figures in the literary world. Charles Sumner,
the brilliant statesman and reformer, was an
intimate friend of her brother, and through
him she met Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, who
not long after became her husband.</p>

<p>From both Longfellow and Sumner Miss
Ward had heard glowing accounts of their
friend Howe, who was, they declared, the truest
hero that America and the nineteenth century
had produced and the best of good comrades.
He had earned the name of "Chevalier" among
his friends because he was "a true Bayard,
without fear and without reproach," and because
he had, moreover, been made a Knight of
St. George by the King of Greece for distinguished
services during the Greek war for
independence. For six years he had fought
with the patriots, both in the field and as
surgeon-in-chief. While in hiding with his
wounded among the bare rocks of the heights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
he had sometimes nothing to eat but roasted
wasps and mountain snails. When the people
were without food, he had returned to America,
related far and wide the story of Greece's struggles
and dire need, and brought back a shipload
of food and clothing. Having relieved the
distress of the people, he had helped them to
get in touch with normal existence once more
by putting them to work. A hospital was
built, and a mole to enclose the harbor at
Ægina. Then, after seeing the hitherto distracted
peasants begin a new life as self-respecting
farmers, he had returned to America.</p>

  <div class="caption">Julia Ward Howe
</div></div>

<p>At this time he was doing pioneer work in the
education of the blind. As director of the
Perkins Institution, in Boston, he was not only
laboring to make more efficient this first school
for the blind in America, but he was also going
about through the country with his pupils to
show something of what might be done in the
way of practical training, in order to induce the
legislatures of the several States to provide
similar institutions for those deprived of sight.
In particular, Dr. Howe's success in teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Laura Bridgman, a blind deaf-mute, was the
marvel of the civilized world.</p>

<p>One day, when Longfellow and Sumner were
calling upon Miss Ward, they suggested driving
over to the Perkins Institution. When they
arrived the hero of the hour&mdash;and the place&mdash;was
absent. Before they left, however, Mr.
Sumner, who had been looking out of the window,
suddenly exclaimed, "There is Howe now
on his black horse!" Miss Ward looked with
considerable eagerness in her curiosity, and
saw, as she afterward said, "a noble rider on
a noble steed."</p>

<p>In this way the Chevalier rode into the life
of the fair lady. As the knight of the ballad
swung the maiden of his choice to the croup
of his charger and galloped off with her in the
face of her helpless kinsmen, so this serious
philanthropist and reformer carried off the
lovely society favorite, in spite of the fact that
he cared not at all for her gay, care-free world,
and was, moreover, twenty years her senior.
The following portion of a letter which Miss
Ward wrote to her brother Sam shows how
completely she was won:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Chevalier says truly&mdash;I am the captive of his bow
and spear. His true devotion has won me from the world
and from myself. The past is already fading from my
sight; already I begin to live with him in the future, which
shall be as calmly bright as true love can make it. I am
perfectly satisfied to sacrifice to one so noble and earnest
the day-dreams of my youth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Howe and his bride went to Europe on
their wedding-trip&mdash;on the same steamer with
Horace Mann and his newly made wife, Mary
Peabody, the sister of Mrs. Nathaniel Hawthorne.
The teacher of Laura Bridgman was
well known in England through Dickens's
"American Notes," and people were anxious to
do him honor. Dickens not only invited the
interesting Americans to dinner, but he offered
to pilot Dr. Howe and his brother reformer,
Horace Mann, about darkest London and show
them the haunts of misery and crime which no
one knew better than the author of "Oliver
Twist," "Little Dorrit," and "Bleak House."
The following note, written in Dickens's characteristic
hand, shows the zest with which the
great novelist undertook these expeditions and
his boyish love of fun:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My dear Howe,&mdash;Drive to-night to St. Giles's Church.
Be there at half past 11&mdash;and wait. Somebody will put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
his head into the coach after a Venetian and mysterious
fashion, and breathe your name. Follow that man. Trust
him to the death.</p>

<p>So no more at present from</p>

<p class="in0">Ninth June, 1843. &nbsp; <span class="in4 smcap">The Mask.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It had been the plan to go from England to
Berlin; but Dr. Howe, who had once incurred
the displeasure of the king of Prussia by giving
aid to certain Polish refugees, and had, indeed,
been held for five weeks in a German prison,
was now excluded from the country as a
"dangerous person." This greatly amused
Horace Mann, who remarked, "When we consider
that His Majesty has 200,000 men constantly
under arms, and can in need increase
the number to two million, we begin to appreciate
the estimation in which he holds your
single self." When, some years later, the king
sent Dr. Howe a medal in recognition of his
work for the blind, the Chevalier declared
laughingly: "It is worth just what I was
obliged to pay for board and lodging while in
the Berlin prison. His Majesty is magnanimous!"</p>

<p>After traveling through Switzerland, Italy,
and France, the Howes stopped for a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
visit to England, where they were entertained
for a time by the parents of Florence Nightingale.
A warm attachment sprang up between
them and the earnest young woman of twenty-four.</p>

<p>"I want to ask your advice, Dr. Howe," said
Miss Nightingale, one day. "Would it be unsuitable
for a young Englishwoman to devote
herself to works of charity in hospitals and
wherever needed, just as the Catholic sisters
do?"</p>

<p>The doctor replied gravely, "My dear Miss
Florence, it would be unusual, and in England
whatever is unusual is apt to be thought unsuitable;
but I say to you, go forward, if you have
a vocation for that way of life; act up to your
inspiration, and you will find that there is never
anything unbecoming or unladylike in doing
your duty for the good of others."</p>

<p>After the Howes had returned to Boston and
settled down to the work-a-day order in the Institution
the young wife's loyalty to the new
life was often sorely tried. She loved the sunshine
of the bright, gracious world of leisurely,
happy people, and she felt herself chilled in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
bleak gray place of sober duties. If only she
could warm herself at the fire of friendship
oftener! But all the pleasant people lived in
pleasant places too far from the South Boston
institution for the give and take of easy intercourse.
Dr. Howe, moreover, was much of the
time so absorbed in the causes of which he was
champion-in-chief that few hours were saved
for quiet fireside enjoyment.</p>

<p>"I hardly know what I should have done in
those days," said Mrs. Howe, "without the
companionship of my babies and Miss Catherine
Beecher's cook-book."</p>

<p>The Chevalier loved to invite for a weekly
dinner his especial group of intimates&mdash;five
choice spirits, among whom Longfellow and
Sumner were numbered, who styled themselves
"The Five of Clubs." These dinners brought
many new problems to the young hostess, who
now wished that some portion of her girlhood
days lavished on Italian and music had been
devoted to the more intimate side of menus.
However, she was before long able to take pride
in her puddings without renouncing poetry;
and to keep an eye on the economy of the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
and her sense of humor at the same time, as
the following extract from a breezy letter to
her sister Louisa can testify:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our house has been enlivened of late by two delightful
visits. The first was from the soap-fat merchant, who
gave me thirty-four pounds of good soap for my grease.
I was quite beside myself with joy, capered about in the
most enthusiastic manner, and was going to hug in turn
the soap, the grease, and the man, when I reflected that it
would not sound well in history. This morning came the
rag man, who takes rags and gives nice tin vessels in exchange....
Both of these were clever transactions. Oh, if
you had seen me stand by the soap-fat man, and scrutinize
his weights and measures, telling him again and again that
it was beautiful grease, and that he must allow me a good
price for it&mdash;truly, I am a mother in Israel.</p></blockquote>

<p>The hours spent with her wee daughters were
happy times. Sometimes she improvised jingles
to amuse Baby Flossy (Florence, after
Florence Nightingale) and tease the absorbed
father-reformer at the same time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">Rero, rero, riddlety rad,</div>
<div class="line">This morning my baby caught sight of her dad,</div>
<div class="line">Quoth she, "Oh, Daddy, where have you been?"</div>
<div class="line">"With Mann and Sumner a-putting down sin!"</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Sometimes she sang little bedtime rhymes about
lambs and baby birds, sheep and sleep; and,
when the small auditors demanded that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
particular pets have a part in the song, readily
added:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">The little donkey in the stable</div>
<div class="line">Sleeps as sound as he is able;</div>
<div class="line">All things now their rest pursue,</div>
<div class="line">You are sleepy too.</div>
</div></div>

<p>As soon as Dr. Howe could find a suitable
place near the Institution he moved his little
family into a home of their own. On the bright
summer day when Mrs. Howe drove under the
bower formed by the fine old trees that guarded
the house, she exclaimed, "Oh, this is green
peace!" And "Green Peace" their home was
called from that day. The children enjoyed
here healthful outdoor times and happy indoor
frolics&mdash;plays given at their dolls' theater, when
father and mother worked the puppets to a
dialogue of squeaks and grunts; and really-truly
plays, such as "The Three Bears" (when
Father distinguished himself as the Great Big
Huge Bear), "The Rose and the Ring," and
"Bluebeard."</p>

<p>In the midst of the joys and cares of such
a rich home-life, how was it that the busy
mother still found time for study and writing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
For she was always a student, keeping her mind
in training as an athlete keeps his muscles; and
the need of finding expression in words for her
inner life became more insistent as time went
on. One of her daughters once said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was a matter of course to us children that 'Papa
and Mamma' should play with us, sing to us, tell us stories,
bathe our bumps, and accompany us to the dentist; these
were the things that papas and mammas did! Looking
back now with some realization of all the other things
they did, we wonder how they managed it. For one thing,
both were rapid workers; for another, both had the power
of leading and inspiring others to work; for a third,
so far as we can see, neither wasted a moment; for a
fourth, neither ever reached a point where there was
not some other task ahead, to be begun as soon as might
be."</p></blockquote>

<p>Life with the beloved reformer was often far
from easy, but there were never any regrets for
the old care-free days. "I shipped as captain's
mate for the voyage!" she said on one occasion,
with a merry laugh that was like a heartening
cheer; and then she added seriously, "I cannot
imagine a more useful motto for married life."
Always she realized that she owed all that was
deepest and most steadfast in herself to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
union. "But for the Chevalier, I should have
been merely a woman of the world and a literary
dabbler!" she said.</p>

<p>A volume of verse, "Passion Flowers," was
praised by Longfellow and Whittier and won
a wide popularity. A later collection, "Words
for the Hour," was, on the whole, better, but
not so much read. Still, the woman felt that
she had not yet really found herself in her
work. She longed to give something that was
vital&mdash;something that would fill a need and
make a difference to people in the real world
of action.</p>

<p>The days of the Civil War made every earnest
spirit long to be of some service to the nation
and to humanity. Dr. Howe and his
friend were among the leaders of the Abolitionists
at the time when they were a despised
"party of cranks and martyrs." It was small
wonder that, when the struggle came, Mrs.
Howe's soul was fired with the desire to help.
There seemed nothing that she could do but
scrape lint for the hospitals&mdash;which any other
woman could do equally well. If only her poetic
gift were not such a slender reed&mdash;if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
could but command an instrument of trumpet
strength to voice the spirit of the hour!</p>

<p>In this mood she had gone to Washington to
see a review of the troops. On returning, while
her carriage was delayed by the marching regiments,
her companions tried to relieve the tensity
and tedium of the wait by singing war
songs, among others:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave;</div>
<div class="line">His soul is marching on!"</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The passing soldiers caught at this with a
"Good for you!" and joined in the chorus.
"Mrs. Howe," said her minister, James Freeman
Clarke, who was one of the company, "why
do you not write some really worthy words for
that stirring tune?"</p>

<p>"I have often wished to do so," she replied.</p>

<p>Let us tell the story of the writing of the
"nation's song" as her daughters have told it
in the biography of their mother:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Waking in the gray of the next morning, as she lay
waiting for the dawn the word came to her.</p>

<p>"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the
Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lay perfectly still. Line by line, stanza by stanza,
the words came sweeping on with the rhythm of marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
feet, pauseless, resistless. She saw the long lines swinging
into place before her eyes, heard the voice of the nation
speaking through her lips. She waited till the voice was
silent, till the last line was ended; then sprang from bed,
and, groping for pen and paper, scrawled in the gray
twilight the "Battle Hymn of the Republic."</p></blockquote>

<p>And so the "nation's song" was born. How
did it come to pass that the people knew it as
their own? When it appeared in the "Atlantic
Monthly" it called forth little comment; the
days gave small chance for the poetry of words.
But some poets in the real world of deeds had
seen it&mdash;the people who were fighting on the
nation's battle-fields. And again and again it
was sung and chanted as a prayer before battle
and a trumpet-call to action. A certain fighting
chaplain, who had committed it to memory,
sang it one memorable night in Libby Prison,
when the joyful tidings of the victory of Gettysburg
had penetrated even those gloomy walls.
"Like a flame the word flashed through the
prison. Men leaped to their feet, shouted, embraced
one another in a frenzy of joy and triumph;
and Chaplain McCabe, standing in the
middle of the room, lifted up his great voice
and sang aloud:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!"</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Every voice took up the chorus, and Libby
Prison rang with the shout of 'Glory, glory,
hallelujah!'"</p>

<p>Later, when Chaplain McCabe related to a
great audience in Washington the story of that
night and ended by singing the "Battle Hymn
of the Republic," as only one who has lived it
can sing it, the voice of Abraham Lincoln was
heard above the wild applause, calling, as the
tears rolled down his cheeks, "Sing it again!"</p>

<p>It has been said that what a person does in
some great moment of his life&mdash;in a moment of
fiery trial or of high exaltation&mdash;is the result of
all the thoughts and deeds of all the slow-changing
days. So the habits of a lifetime cry out
at last. Is it not true that this "nation's
song," which seemed to write itself in a wonderful
moment of inspiration, was really the expression
of years of brave, faithful living? All
the earnestness of the child, all the dreams and
warm friendliness of the girl, all the tenderness
and loyal devotion of the wife and mother,
speak in those words. Nor is it the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
her life alone. The trumpet-call of her forebears
was in those stirring lines. Only a tried
and true American, whose people had fought
and suffered for freedom's sake, could have
written that nation's song.</p>

<p>Julia Ward Howe's long life of ninety-one
years was throughout one of service and inspiration.
Many people were better and happier
because of her life. It was a great moment
when, on the occasion of any public gathering,
the word went around that Mrs. Howe
was present. With one accord those assembled
would rise to their feet, and hall or theater
would ring with the inspiring lines of the
"Battle Hymn of the Republic."</p>

<p>The man who said, "I care not who shall
make the laws of the nation, if I may be permitted
to make its songs," spoke wisely. A
true song comes from the heart and goes to the
heart. A nation's song is the voice of the heart
and life of a whole people. In it the hearts of
many beat together as one.</p>

<h2>A CHAMPION OF "THE CAUSE"</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmin"> YOUNG</span> girl was standing on a stump
in the woods, waving her arms and
talking very earnestly. There was no one
there to listen except a robin a-tilt on a branch
where the afternoon sun could turn his rusty
brown breast to red, and a chattering, inquisitive
bluejay. All the other little wood folk
were in hiding. That strange creature was in
the woods but not of them. She belonged to
the world of people.</p>

<p>The girl knew that she belonged to a different
world. She was not trying to play that she
was a little American Saint Francis preaching
to the birds in the forests of northern Michigan.
She was looking past the great trees and
all the busy life that lurked there to the far-away
haunts of men. Somehow she felt that
she would have something to say to them some
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
She raised her clasped hands high above her
head and lifted her face to the patch of sky
that gleamed deep blue between the golden-green
branches of the trees. "There is much
that I can say," she declared fervently. "I
am only a girl, but I feel in my heart that some
day people will listen to me."</p>

<p>A gray squirrel scampered noisily across the
dry brown leaves and frisked up a tree trunk,
where he clung for a moment regarding the
girl on the stump with shining, curious eyes.</p>

<p>"Saucy nutcracker!" cried the child, tossing
an acorn at the alert little creature. "Do
you too think it strange for a girl to want to do
things? What would you say if I should tell
you that a young girl once led a great army to
victory?&mdash;a poor girl who had to work hard all
day just as I do? She did not know how to
read or write, but she knew how to answer all
the puzzling questions that the learned and
powerful men of the day (who tried with all
their might to trip her up) could think to ask.
They called her a witch then. 'Of a truth this
girl Joan must be possessed of an evil spirit,'
they said. 'Who ever heard of a maid speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
as she speaks?' Years afterward they
called her a saint. She was the leader of her
people even though she was a girl&mdash;Now I
don't mean, fellow birds and squirrels, that I
expect to be another Joan of Arc, but I know
that I shall be something!"</p>

<p>Anna Shaw's bright dark eyes glowed with
intense feeling. Like the maid of whom she
had been reading, she had her vision&mdash;a vision
of a large, happy life waiting for her&mdash;little,
untaught backwoods girl though she was. Her
book led the way down a charmed path into the
world of dreams. For the time she forgot the
drudgery of the days&mdash;the plowing and planting
and hoeing about the stumps of their little
clearing, the cutting of wood, the carrying of
water. She walked back to the cabin that was
home, with her head held high and her lips
parted in a smile. But all at once she was
brought back to real things with a rude bump.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing, Anna?" demanded
her father, who stood waiting for her
in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Reading, sir," the girl faltered.</p>

<p>"So you have been <i>idling</i> away precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
hours at a time your mother has needed your
help?" the stern voice went on accusingly.
"What do you suppose the future will bring to
one who has not proved 'faithful in little'?"</p>

<p>The girl looked at her father without speaking.
She knew that her share in the work of
the household was not "little." Her young
hands hardened from rough toil twitched nervously;
the injustice cut her to the quick.
Couldn't her father imagine what holding
down that claim in the woods had meant for
the little family during the eighteen months
that he and the two older boys had remained
behind in the East? In his joy at securing the
grant of land from the Government, he already
pictured the well-conditioned farm that would
one day be his and his children's. "The acorn
was not an acorn, but a forest of young oaks."</p>

<p>In a flash she saw as if it were yesterday the
afternoon when their pathetic little caravan had
at last reached the home that awaited them.
She saw the frail, tired mother give one glance
at the rude log hut in the stump-filled clearing,
and then sink in a despairing heap on the dirt
floor. It was but the hollow shell of a cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>&mdash;walls
and roof, with square holes for door
and windows gaping forlornly at the home-seekers.
She heard the wolves and wildcats
as she had on that first night when they had
huddled together&mdash;helpless creatures from another
world&mdash;not knowing if their watch-fires
would keep the hungry beasts at bay. She saw
parties of Indians stalk by in war-paint and
feathers. She saw herself, a child of twelve,
trudging wearily to the distant creek for water
until the time when, with her brother's help,
she dug a well. There was, too, the work of
laying a floor and putting in doors and windows.
Like Robinson Crusoe, she had served
a turn at every trade; to-day that of carpenter
or builder, to-morrow that of farmer, fisherman,
or woodcutter.</p>

<p>As these pictures flashed before the eye of
memory she looked at her father quietly, without
a word of defense or self-pity. All she said
was, "Father, some day I am going to college."</p>

<p>The little smile that curled his lips as he
looked his astonishment drove her to another
boast. The dreams of the free calm woods and
the heroic Maid of Orleans had faded away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Somehow she longed to put forth her claim in
a way to impress any one, even a man who felt
that a girl ought not to want anything but
drudging. "And before I die I shall be worth
$10,000," she prophesied boldly.</p>

<p>However, the months that succeeded gave no
sign of any change of fortune. A sudden storm
turned a day of toil now and then into a red-letter
day when one had chance to read the
books that father had brought with him into the
wilderness. Sometimes one could stretch at
ease on the floor and dreamily scan the pages
of the "Weekly" that papered the walls.
There was always abundant opportunity in the
busy hours that followed to reflect on what one
had read&mdash;to compare, to contrast, and to apply,
and so to annex for good and all the ideas
that the books had to give.</p>

<p>It was clear, too, that there were many interesting
things to be seen and enjoyed even in
the most humdrum work-a-day round, if one
were able to read real life as well as print.
Could anything be more delightful than the
way father would drop his hoe and run into the
house to work out a problem concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
yield of a certain number of kernels of corn?
The days would go by while he calculated and
speculated energetically over this problem and
that, leaving such trivial tasks as planting and
plowing to others. Then there were the weekend
visitors. Often as many as ten or a dozen
of the neighboring settlers&mdash;big lumbermen and
farmers&mdash;would come on Saturday, to spend
the night and Sunday listening to her father
read. When it was delicately hinted that this
was a tax on the family store of tallow dips,
each man dutifully brought a candle to light
the way to learning. It never seemed to occur,
either to them or to the impractical father,
who liked nothing better than reading and expounding,
that the entertainment of so many
guests was a severe tax on the strength and
patience of the working members of the household.</p>

<p>But life was not all labor. There was now
and then a wonderful ball at Big Rapids, then
a booming lumber town. When it was impossible
to get any sort of a team to make the journey,
they went down the river on a raft, taking
their party dresses in trunks. As balls, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
other good things in pioneer experience, were
all too rare, it was the custom to make the most
of each occasion by changing one's costume at
midnight, and thus starting off with fresh enthusiasm
to dance the "money musk" and the
"Virginia reel" in the small hours.</p>

<p>"Our costumes in those days had at least the
spice of originality," said Miss Shaw with a
reminiscent smile. "I well remember a certain
gay ball gown of my own, made of bedroom
chintz; and the home-tailored trousers of my
gallant swain, whose economical mother had
employed flour sacks, on which the local firm-name
and the guarantee, '96 pounds,' appeared
indelibly imprinted. A blue flannel shirt and a
festive yellow sash completed his interesting
outfit."</p>

<p>When Anna Shaw was fifteen she began to
teach in the little log schoolhouse of the settlement
for two dollars a week and "board
round." The day's work often meant a walk
of from three to six miles, a trip to the woods
for fuel, the making of the wood fire and the
partial drying of rain-soaked clothes, before
instruction began. Then imagine the child of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
fifteen teaching fifteen children of assorted ages
and dispositions out of fifteen different "reading
books," most of which she had herself supplied.
"I remember that one little girl read
from a hymn-book, while another had an almanac,"
she said.</p>

<p>As there was no money for such luxuries as
education until the dog-tax had been collected,
the young teacher received one bright spring
day the dazzling sum of twenty-six dollars for
the entire term of thirteen weeks. In the
spending of this wealth, spring and youth
carried the day. Joan of Arc and the preaching
in the woods were for the time forgotten;
she longed above everything else to have some
of the pretty things that all girls love. Making
a pilgrimage to a real shop, she bought her
first real party dress&mdash;a splendid creation of
rich magenta color, elaborately decorated with
black braid.</p>

<p>Perhaps she regretted all too soon the rashness
of this expenditure, for the next year
brought hard times. War had been declared,
and Lincoln's call for troops had taken all the
able-bodied men of the community. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
news came that Fort Sumter had been fired
on," said Miss Shaw, "our men were threshing.
I remember seeing a man ride up on
horseback, shouting out Lincoln's demand for
troops and explaining that a regiment was being
formed at Big Rapids. Before he had finished
speaking the men on the machine had
leaped to the ground and rushed off to enlist,
my brother Jack, who had recently joined us,
among them."</p>

<p>Anna Shaw was now the chief support of the
little home in the wilderness, and the pitiful
sum earned by teaching had to be eked out by
boarding the workers from the lumber-camps
and taking in sewing, in order to pay the taxes
and meet the bare necessities of life. With
calico selling for fifty cents a yard, coffee for
a dollar a pound, and everything else in proportion,
one cannot but marvel how the women
and children managed to exist. They struggled
along, with hearts heavy with anxiety for
loved ones on the battle-fields, to do as best
they could the work of the men&mdash;gathering in
the crops, grinding the corn, and caring for
the cattle&mdash;in addition to the homekeeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
tasks of the daily round. It takes, perhaps,
more courage and endurance to be a faithful
member of the home army than it does to march
into battle with bands playing and colors flying.</p>

<p>When, at the end of the war, the return of
the father and brothers freed her from the responsibility
for the upkeep of the home, Anna
Shaw determined upon a bold step. Realizing
that years must pass before she could save
enough from her earnings as country school-teacher
to go to college, she went to live with a
married sister in Big Rapids and entered as a
pupil in the high school there. The preceptress,
Miss Lucy Foot, who was a college graduate
and a woman of unusual strength of character,
took a lively interest in the new student
and encouraged her ambition to preach by putting
her in the classes in public speaking and
debating.</p>

<p>"I vividly remember my first recitation in
public," said Miss Shaw. "I was so overcome
by the impressiveness of the audience and the
occasion, and so appalled at my own boldness
in standing there, that I sank in a faint on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
platform. Sympathetic classmates carried me
out and revived me, after which they naturally
assumed that the entertainment I furnished
was over for the evening. I, however, felt
that if I let that failure stand against me I
could never afterward speak in public; and
within ten minutes, notwithstanding the protests
of my friends, I was back in the hall and
beginning my recitation a second time. The
audience gave me its eager attention. Possibly
it hoped to see me topple off the platform
again, but nothing of the sort occurred. I
went through the recitation with self-possession
and received some friendly applause at
the end."</p>

<p>After this maiden speech, the young girl appeared
frequently in public, now in school debates,
now in amateur theatricals. It was as
if the Fates had her case particularly in hand
at this time, for everything seemed to further
the secret longing that had possessed her ever
since the days when she had preached to the
trees in the forest.</p>

<p>There was a growing sentiment in favor of
licensing women to preach in the Methodist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Church, and Dr. Peck, the presiding elder of
the Big Rapids district, who was chief among
the advocates of the movement, was anxious to
present the first woman candidate for the ministry.
Meeting the alert, ardent young student
at the home of her teacher, Dr. Peck took pains
to draw her into conversation. Soon she was
talking freely, with eager animation, and her
questioner was listening with interest, nodding
approval now and then. Then an amazing
thing happened. Dr. Peck looked at her smilingly
and asked in an off-hand manner:</p>

<p>"Would you like to preach the quarterly sermon
at Ashton?"</p>

<p>The young woman gasped; she stared at the
good man in astonishment. Then she realized
that he was speaking in entire seriousness.</p>

<p>"Why," she stammered, "I can't preach a
sermon!"</p>

<p>"Have you ever tried?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never!" she began, and then as the picture
of her childish self standing on the stump in
the sunlit woods flashed upon her, "Never to
human beings!" she amended.</p>

<p>Dr. Peck was smiling again. "Well," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
said, "the door is open. Enter or not, as you
wish."</p>

<p>After much serious counsel with Miss Foot
and with her own soul, Anna Shaw determined
to go in at the open door. For six weeks the
preparation of the first sermon engaged most
of her waking thoughts, and even in her dreams
the text she had chosen sounded in her ears.
It was, moreover, a time of no little anguish
of spirit because of the consternation with
which her family regarded her unusual "call."
One might as well be guilty of crime, it appeared,
as to be so forward and unwomanly.
Finding it impossible to bring her to reason in
any other way, they tried a bribe. After a
solemn gathering of the clans, it was agreed
that if she would give up this insane ambition
to preach, they would send her to college&mdash;to
Ann Arbor&mdash;and defray all her expenses.
The thought of Ann Arbor was a sore temptation;
but she realized that she could no more be
faithless to the vision that had been with her
from childhood than she could cease being herself.</p>

<p>The momentous first sermon was the forerunner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of many others in different places, and
when at the conference the members were asked
to vote whether she should be licensed as a
local preacher, the majority of the ministers
raised both hands!</p>

<p>She was, however, still regarded as the black
sheep of the family, and it was with a heavy
spirit that she plodded on day by day with her
studies. Surely nobody was ever more in need
of a friendly word than was Anna Shaw at the
time that Mary A. Livermore came to lecture
in Big Rapids. At the close of the meeting
she was among those gathered in a circle about
the distinguished speaker, when some one
pointed her out, remarking that "there was a
young person who wanted to preach in spite
of the opposition and entreaties of all her
friends."</p>

<p>Mrs. Livermore looked into Anna Shaw's
glowing eyes with sudden interest; then she
put her arm about her and said quietly, "My
dear, if you want to preach, go on and preach.
No matter what people say, don't let them
stop you!"</p>

<p>Before Miss Shaw could choke back her emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
sufficiently to reply, one of her good
friends exclaimed: "Oh, Mrs. Livermore,
don't say that to her! We're all trying to
stop her. Her people are wretched over the
whole thing. And don't you see how ill she
is? She has one foot in the grave and the
other almost there!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Livermore, looking
thoughtfully at the white face that was turned
appealingly toward her, "I see she has. But
it is better that she should die doing the thing
she wants to do than that she should die because
she can't do it."</p>

<p>"So they think I'm going to die!" cried
Miss Shaw. "Well, I'm not! I'm going to
live and preach!"</p>

  Anna Howard Shaw
</div></div>

<p>With renewed zeal and courage she turned
again to her books, and, in the autumn of 1873,
entered Albion College. "With only eighteen
dollars as my entire capital," she said, "and
not the least idea how I might add to it, I was
approaching the campus when I picked up a
copper cent bearing the date of my birth, 1848.
It seemed to me a good omen, and I was sure
of it when within the week I found two more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
pennies exactly like it. Though I have more
than once been tempted to spend those pennies,
I have them still&mdash;to my great comfort!"</p>

<p>At college she was distinguished for her independence
of thought and for her alert, vigorous
mind. When, on being invited to join the
literary society that boasted both men and
women members instead of the exclusively
feminine group, she was assured that "women
need to be associated with men because they
don't know how to manage meetings," she replied
with spirit:</p>

<p>"If they don't, it's high time they learned.
I shall join the women, and we'll master the
art."</p>

<p>Her gift as a public speaker not only earned
her a place of prominence in her class through
her able debates and orations, but it also helped
pay her way through college, since she received
now and then five dollars for a temperance talk
in one of the near-by country schoolhouses.
But such sums came at uncertain intervals, and
her board bills came due with discouraging
regularity. A gift of ninety-two dollars, sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
at Christmas by her friends in Big Rapids,
alone made it possible for her to get through
the term.</p>

<p>Though the second year at Albion was comparatively
smooth sailing because her reputation
had brought enough "calls" to preach and
lecture to defray her modest expenses, she decided
to go to Boston University for her
theological course. She was able to make her
way in the West; why was it not possible to
do the same in the place where she could get
the needed equipment for her life work?</p>

<p>But she soon found what it means to be alone
and penniless in a large city. Opportunities
were few and hungry students were many.
For the first time in her life she was tempted
to give up and own herself beaten, when a sudden
rift came in the clouds of discouragement.
She was invited to assist in holding a "revival
week" in one of the Boston churches.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that one could live on
milk and crackers if only hope were added.
The week's campaign was a great success. If
she herself had not been able to feel the fervor
and enthusiasm that the meetings had aroused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
she could have no doubt when the minister assured
her that her help had proved invaluable&mdash;that
he greatly wished he were able to
give her the fifty dollars, which at the very
lowest estimate she deserved&mdash;but alas! he had
nothing to offer but his heartfelt thanks!</p>

<p>When Miss Shaw passed out of the church
her heart was indeed heavy. She had failed!
"I was friendless, penniless, and starving,"
she said, "but it was not of these conditions
that I thought then. The one overwhelming
fact was that I had been weighed and found
wanting. I was not worthy."</p>

<p>All at once she felt a touch on her arm. An
old woman who had evidently been waiting for
her to come out put a five-dollar bill in her
hand. "I am a poor woman, Miss Shaw," she
said, "but I have all I need, and I want to make
you a little present, for I know how hard life
must be for you young students. I'm the happiest
woman in the world to-night, and I owe
my happiness to you. You have converted my
grandson, who is all I have left, and he is going
to lead a different life."</p>

<p>"This is the biggest gift I have ever had,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
cried Miss Shaw. "This little bill is big
enough to carry my future on its back!"</p>

<p>This was indeed the turning point. Here
was enough for food and shoes, but it was much
more than that. It was a sign that she had
her place in the great world. There was need
of what she could do, and there could be no
more doubt that <i>her</i> needs would be met. Even
though she could not see the path ahead she
would never lose heart again.</p>

<p>The succeeding months brought not only the
means to live but also the spirit to make the
most of each day's living. "I graduated in a
new black silk gown," she said, "with five dollars
in my pocket, which I kept there during
the graduation exercises. I felt special satisfaction
in the possession of that money, for,
notwithstanding the handicap of being a
woman, I was said to be the only member of
my class who had worked during the entire
course, graduated free from debt, and had a
new outfit as well as a few dollars in cash."</p>

<p>Miss Shaw's influence as a preacher may be
illustrated by a single anecdote. In the
months following her graduation she went on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
trip to Europe, a friend having left her a
bequest for that express purpose. While in
Genoa she was asked to preach to the sailors in
a gospel-ship in the harbor; but when she appeared
it was evident that the missionary in
charge had not understood that the minister he
had invited was a woman. He was unhappy
and apologetic in his introduction, and the
weather-beaten tars, in their turn, looked both
resentful and mocking. It was certainly a trying
moment when Miss Shaw began to speak.
She had never in her life felt more forlorn or
more homesick, when all at once the thought
flashed through her that back of those unfriendly
faces that confronted her there were
lonely souls just as hungry for home as she
was. Impulsively stepping down from the pulpit
so that she stood on a level with her hearers,
she said:</p>

<p>"My friends, I hope you will forget everything
that Dr. Blank has just said. It is true
that I am a minister and that I came here to
preach. But now I do not intend to preach&mdash;only
to have a friendly talk, on a text that is
not in the Bible. I am very far from home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
and I feel as homesick as some of you men look.
So my text is, 'Blessed are the homesick, for
they shall go home.'"</p>

<p>Then out of the knowledge of sea-faring
people which she had gained during summer
vacations when she had "filled in" for the absent
pastor of a little church on Cape Cod, she
talked in a way that went straight to the hearts
of the rough men gathered there. When she
saw that the unpleasant grin had vanished
from the face of the hardest old pirate of them
all, she said: "When I came here I intended
to preach a sermon on 'The Heavenly Vision.'
Now I want to give you a glimpse of that in
addition to the vision we have had of home."</p>

<p>After her return to America, Miss Shaw was
called as pastor to a church at East Dennis,
Cape Cod, and a few months later she was
asked to hold services at another church about
three miles distant. These two charges she
held for seven happy years, rich in the opportunity
for real service.</p>

<p>Feeling the need of knowing how to minister
to the bodily needs of those she labored among,
Miss Shaw took a course at the Boston Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
School, going to the city for a part of each
week and graduating with the degree of M.D.
in 1885. When some one who knew about her
untiring work as leader and helper of the people
to whom she preached, asked her how it
had been possible for her to endure so great
a strain, she replied cheerfully, "Congenial
work, no matter how much there is of it, has
never yet killed any one."</p>

<p>During the time of her medical studies when
Miss Shaw was serving as volunteer doctor and
nurse to the poor in the Boston slums, she became
interested in the cause of woman suffrage&mdash;"The
Cause" it was to her always in the
years that succeeded. A new day had come
with new needs. She saw that everywhere
there were changed conditions and grave problems
brought about by the entrance of women
into the world of wage-earners; and she became
convinced that only through an understanding
and sharing of the responsibilities of
citizenship by both men and women could the
best interests of each community be served.
She, therefore, gave up her church work on
Cape Cod to become a lecturer in a larger field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
For a while she devoted part of her time to the
temperance crusade until that great leader of
the woman's movement, Susan B. Anthony&mdash;"Aunt
Susan," as she was affectionately
called&mdash;persuaded her to give all her strength
to the Cause.</p>

<p>Without an iron constitution and steady
nerves, as well as an unfailing sense of humor,
she could never have met the hardships and
strange chances that were her portion in the
years that succeeded. In order to meet the
appointments of her lecture tours she was constantly
traveling, often under the most untoward
circumstances&mdash;now finding herself snow-bound
in a small prairie town; now compelled
to cross a swollen river on an uncertain trestle;
now stricken with an attack of ptomaine poisoning
while "on the road," with no one within
call except a switchman in his signal-tower.</p>

<p>Perhaps more appalling than any or all of
these tests was the occasion when she arrived
in a town to find that the lecture committee had
advertised her as "the lady who whistled before
Queen Victoria," and announced that she
would speak on "The Missing link." When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
she ventured to protest, the manager remarked
amiably that they had "mixed her up with a
Shaw lady that whistles."</p>

<p>"But I don't know anything about the 'missing
link'!" continued Miss Shaw.</p>

<p>"Well, you see we chose that subject because
they have been talking about it in the Debating
Society, and we knew it would arouse interest,"
she was assured. "Just bring in a reference
to it every now and then, and it'll be all right."</p>

<p>"Open the meeting with a song so that I can
think for a minute and then I'll see what can
be done," said Miss Shaw pluckily. As the expectant
audience, led by the chairman, sang with
patriotic fervor "The Star Spangled Banner"
and "America," the shipwrecked lecturer managed
to seize a straw of inspiration that turned
in her grasp magically into a veritable life-preserver.
"It is easy," she said to herself.
"Woman is the missing link in our government.
I'll give them a suffrage speech along that
line."</p>

<p>Miss Shaw has labored many years for the
Cause. She worked with courage, dignity, and
unfailing common sense and good humor, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
day of small things when the suffrage pioneers
were ridiculed by both men and women as a
band of unwomanly "freaks" and fanatics.
She has lived to see the Cause steadily grow in
following and influence, and State after State
(particularly those of the growing, progressive
West) call upon women to share equally with
men many of the duties of citizenship and social
service. She has seen that in such States there
is no disposition to go back to the old order of
things, and that open-minded people freely admit
that it is only a question of time until the
more conservative parts of the country will fall
into line and equal suffrage become nation wide.</p>

<p>Her days have been rich in happy work,
large usefulness, and inspiring friendships.
Many honors have been showered upon her
both in her own country and abroad; but she
has always looked upon the work which she has
been privileged to do as making the best&mdash;and
the most honorable&mdash;part of her life.</p>

<p>Once, while attending a general conference
of women in Berlin, she won the interest and
real friendship of a certain Italian princess,
who invited her to visit at her castle in Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and also to go with her to her mother's castle
in Austria. As Miss Shaw was firm in declining
these distinguished honors, the princess
begged an explanation.</p>

<p>"Because, my dear princess," Miss Shaw explained,
"I am a working-woman."</p>

<p>"Nobody need <i>know</i> that," murmured the
princess, calmly.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is the first thing I
should explain," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But why?" demanded the princess.</p>

<p>"You are proud of your family, are you
not?" asked Miss Shaw. "You are proud of
your great line?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," replied the princess.</p>

<p>"Very well," continued Miss Shaw. "I am
proud, too. What I have done I have done unaided,
and, to be frank with you, I rather approve
of it. My work is my patent of nobility,
and I am not willing to associate with those
from whom it would have to be concealed or
with those who would look down upon it."</p>

<p>Anna Howard Shaw's autobiography, which
she calls "The Story of a Pioneer," is an absorbingly
interesting and inspiring narrative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
It gives with refreshing directness and wholesome
appreciation the story of her struggles
and her work, together with revealing glimpses
of some of her comrades in the Cause; it is at
once her own story and the story of the pioneer
days of the movement to which she gave her rich
gifts of mind and character. In conclusion she
quotes a speech of a certain small niece, who
was overheard trying to rouse her still smaller
sister to noble indifference in the face of the
ridicule of their playmates, who had laughed
when they had bravely announced that they
were suffragettes.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed of yourself," she demanded,
"to stop just because you are laughed
at once? Look at Aunt Anna! <i>She</i> has been
laughed at for hundreds of years!"</p>

<p>"I sometimes feel," added the Champion of
the Cause, "that it has indeed been hundreds
of years since my work began; and then again
it seems so brief a time that, by listening for a
moment, I fancy I can hear the echo of my childish
voice preaching to the trees in the Michigan
woods. But, long or short, the one sure thing
is that, taking it all in all, the fight has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
worth while. Nothing bigger can come to a
human being than to love a great Cause more
than life itself, and to have the privilege
throughout life of working for that Cause."</p>

<h2>THE MAKING OF A PATRIOT</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="dropleftmin">OU</span> know the story of "The Man without a
Country"&mdash;the man who lost his country
through his own fault. Can you imagine what
it would mean to be a child without a country&mdash;to
have no flag, no heroes, no true native land
to which you belong as you belong to your
family, and which in turn belongs to you? How
would it seem to grow up without the feeling
that you have a big country, a true fatherland
to protect your home and your friends; to build
schools for you; to give you parks and playgrounds,
and clean, beautiful streets; to fight
disease and many dangers on land and water
for you?&mdash;This is the story of a little girl who
was born in a land where she had no chance for
"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
Far from being a true fatherland, her country
was like the cruel stepmother of the old
tales.</p>

<p>It was strange that one could be born in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
country and yet have no right to live there!
Little Maryashe (or Mashke, as she was called,
because she was too tiny a girl for a big-sounding
name) soon learned that the Russia where
she was born was not her own country. It
seemed that the Russians did not love her people,
or want them to live in their big land.
And yet there they were! Truly it was a
strange world.</p>

<p>"Why is Father afraid of the police?" asked
little Mashke. "He has done nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"My child, the trouble is that we can do
nothing right!" cried her mother, wringing her
hands. "Everything is wrong with us. We
have no rights, nothing that we dare to call our
own."</p>

<p>It seemed that Mashke's people had to live in
a special part of the country called the "Pale
of Settlement." It was against the law to go
outside the Pale no matter how hard it was to
make a living where many people of the same
manner of life were herded together, no matter
how much you longed to try your fortune in
a new place. It was not a free land, this Polotzk
where she had been born. It was a prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
with iron laws that shut people away from any
chance for happy living.</p>

<p>It is hard to live in a cage, be it large or small.
Like a wild bird, the free human spirit beats its
wings against any bars.</p>

<p>"Why, Mother, why is it that we must not go
outside the Pale?" asked Mashke.</p>

<p>"Because the Czar and those others who have
the power to make the laws do not love our people;
they hate us and all our ways," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"But why do they hate us, Mother?" persisted
the child with big, earnest eyes.</p>

<p>"Because we are different; because we can
never think like them and be like them. Their
big Russia is not yet big enough to give people
of another sort a chance to live and be happy
in their own way."</p>

<p>Even in crowded Polotzk, though, with police
spying on every side, there were happy days.
There were the beautiful Friday afternoons
when Mashke's father and mother came home
early from the store to put off every sign of the
work-a-day world and make ready for the Sabbath.
The children were allowed to wear their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
holiday clothes and new shoes. They stepped
about happily while their mother hid the great
store keys and the money bag under her featherbed,
and the grandmother sealed the oven and
cleared every trace of work from the kitchen.</p>

<p>How Mashke loved the time of candle prayer!
As she looked at the pure flame of her candle
the light shone in her face and in her heart.
Then she looked at the work-worn faces of her
mother and grandmother. All the lines of care
and trouble were smoothed away in the soft
light. They had escaped from the prison of
this unfriendly land with its hard laws and its
hateful Pale. They were living in the dim but
glorious Past, when their father's fathers had
been a free nation in a land of their own.</p>

<p>But Mashke could not escape from the prison
in that way. She was young and glad to be
alive. Her candle shone for light and life to-day
and to-morrow and to-morrow! There
were no bars that could shut away her free
spirit from the light.</p>

<p>How glad she was for life and sunlight on
the peaceful Sabbath afternoons when, holding
to her father's hand, she walked beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
city streets along the riverside to the place
where in blossoming orchards birds sang of the
joyful life of the air, and where in newly plowed
fields peasants sang the song of planting-time
and the fruitful earth. Her heart leaped as
she felt herself a part of the life that flowed
through all things&mdash;river, air, earth, trees,
birds, and happy, toiling people.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mashke that most of her days
were passed in wondering&mdash;wondering about
the strange world in which she found herself,
and its strange ways. Of course she played as
the children about her did, with her rag doll
and her "jacks" made of the knuckle bones of
sheep; and she learned to dance to the most
spirited tune that could be coaxed from the
teeth of a comb covered with a bit of paper.
In winter she loved to climb in the bare sledge,
which when not actively engaged in hauling
wood could give a wonderful joy-ride to a party
of happy youngsters, who cared nothing that
their sleigh boasted only straw and burlap in
place of cushions and fur robes, and a knotted
rope in place of reins with jingling bells.</p>

<p>But always, winter and summer, in season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
and out of season, Mashke found herself wondering
about the meaning of all the things that
she saw and heard. She wondered about her
hens who gave her eggs and broth, and feathers
for her bed, all in exchange for her careless
largess of grain. Did they ever feel that the
barnyard was a prison? She wondered about
the treadmill horse who went round and round
to pump water for the public baths. Did he
know that he was cheated out of the true life of
a horse&mdash;work-time in cheerful partnership
with man and play-time in the pasture with the
fresh turf under his road-weary hoofs? Did
the women, who toiled over the selfsame tasks
in such a weary round that they looked forward
to the change of wash-day at the river where
they stood knee-deep in the water to rub and
scrub their poor rags, know that they, too, were
in a treadmill?&mdash;Sometimes she could not
sleep for wondering, and would steal from her
bed before daybreak to walk through the dewy
grass of the yard and watch the blackness turn
to soft, dreamy gray. Then the houses seemed
like breathing creatures, and all the world was
hushed and very sweet. Was there ever such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
a wonder as the coming of a new day?&mdash;As
she watched it seemed that her spirit flew beyond
the town, beyond the river and the glowing
sky itself&mdash;touching, knowing, and loving
all things. Her spirit was free!</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed that the wings of her
spirit could all but carry her little body up and
away. She was indeed such a wee mite that
they sometimes called her Mouse and Crumb
and Poppy Seed. All of her eager, flaming life
was in her questioning eyes and her dark, wayward
curls. Because she was small and frail
she was spared the hard work that early fell
to the lot of her older, stronger sister. So it
happened that she had time for her wonderings&mdash;time
for her spirit to grow and try its wings.</p>

<p>Mashke was still a very little child when she
learned a very big truth. She discovered that
there were many prisons besides those made by
Russian laws; she saw that her people often
shut themselves up in prisons of their own
making. There were hundreds of laws and observances&mdash;ways
to wash, to eat, to dress, to
work&mdash;which seemed to many as sacred as their
faith in God. Doubtless the rules which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
now only empty forms had once had meaning,
such as the law forbidding her people to touch
fire on the Sabbath, which came down from a
time before matches or tinder-boxes when making
a fire was hard work. But all good people
observed the letter of the law, and, no matter
what the need of mending a fire or a light, would
wait for a Gentile helper to come to the rescue.</p>

<p>One memorable evening, however, Mashke
saw her father, when he thought himself unobserved,
quietly steal over to the table and turn
down a troublesome lamp. The gleam of a new
light came to the mind of the watching, wondering
child at that moment. She began to understand
that even her father, who was the
wisest man in Polotzk, did many things because
he feared to offend the prejudices of their people,
just as he did many other things because of
fear of the Russian police. There was more
than one kind of a prison.</p>

<p>When Mashke was about ten years old a
great change came to her life. Her father decided
to go on a long journey to a place far
from Polotzk and its rules of life, far from
Russia and its laws of persecution and death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
to a true Promised Land where all people, it was
said, no matter what their nation and belief,
were free to live and be happy in their own
way. The name of this Promised Land was
America. Some friendly people&mdash;the "emigration
society," her father called them&mdash;made
it possible for him to go try his fortune in the
new country. Soon he would make a home
there for them all.</p>

<p>At last the wonderful letter came&mdash;a long letter,
and yet it could not tell the half of his joy
in the Promised Land. He had not found
riches&mdash;no, he had been obliged to borrow the
money for the third-class tickets he was sending
them&mdash;but he had found freedom. Best of
all, his children might have the chance to go to
school and learn the things that make a free
life possible and worth while.</p>

<p>Mashke found that they had suddenly become
the most important people in Polotzk. All the
neighbors gathered about to see the marvelous
tickets that could take a family across the sea.
Cousins who had not thought of them for
months came with gifts and pleadings for letters
from the new world. "Do not forget us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
when you are so happy and grand," they said.</p>

<p>"You will see my boy, my Möshele," cried a
poor mother again and again. "Ask him why
he does not write to us these many months. If
you do not find him in Boston maybe he will be
in Balti-moreh. It is all America."</p>

<p>The day came at last when every stool and
feather-bed was sold, and their clothes and all
the poor treasures they could carry were
wrapped in queer-looking bundles ready to be
taken in their arms to the new home. All of
Polotzk went to the station to wave gay handkerchiefs
and bits of calico and wish them well.
They soon found, however, that the way of the
emigrant is hard. In order to reach the sea
they had to go through Germany to Hamburg,
and a fearful journey it proved to be. It was
soon evident that the Russians were not the only
cruel people in the world; the Germans were
just as cruel in strange and unusual ways, and
in a strange language.</p>

<p>They put the travelers in prison, for which
they had a queer name, of course&mdash;"Quarantine,"
they called it. They drove them like
cattle into a most unpleasant place, where their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
clothes were snatched off, their bodies rubbed
with an evil, slippery substance, and their breath
taken away by an unexpected shower that suddenly
descended on their helpless heads.
Their precious bundles, too, were tossed about
rudely and steamed and smoked. As the poor
victims sat wrapped in clouds of steam waiting
for the final agony, their clothes were brought
back, steaming like everything else, and somebody
cried, "Quick! Quick! or you will lose
your train!" It seemed that they were not to
be murdered after all, but that this was just the
German way of treating people whom they
thought capable of carrying diseases about with
them.</p>

<p>Then came the sixteen days on the big ship,
when Mashke was too ill part of the time even
to think about America. But there were better
days, when the coming of morning found her
near the rail gazing at the path of light that led
across the shimmering waves into the heart of
the golden sky. That way seemed like her own
road ahead into the new life that awaited her.</p>

<p>The golden path really began at a Boston
public school. Here Mashke stood in her new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
American dress of stiff calico and gave a new
American name to the friendly teacher of the
primer class. Mary Antin she was called from
that day, all superfluous foreign letters being
dropped off forever. As her father tried in his
broken English to tell the teacher something of
his hopes for his children, Mary knew by the
look in his eyes that he, too, had a vision of the
path of light. The teacher also saw that glowing,
consecrated look and in a flash of insight
comprehended something of his starved past
and the future for which he longed. In his effort
to make himself understood he talked with
his hands, with his shoulders, with his eyes;
beads of perspiration stood out on his earnest
brow, and now he dropped back helplessly into
Yiddish, now into Russian. "I cannot now
learn what the world knows; I must work. But
I bring my children&mdash;they go to school for me.
I am American citizen; I want my children be
American citizens."</p>

<p>The first thing was, of course, to make a
beginning with the new language. Afterward
when Mary Antin was asked to describe the way
the teacher had worked with her foreign class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
she replied with a smile, "I can't vouch for the
method, but the six children in my own particular
group (ranging in age from six to fifteen&mdash;I
was then twelve) attacked the see-the-cat
and look-at-the-hen pages of our primers with
the keenest zest, eager to find how the common
world looked, smelled, and tasted in the strange
speech, and we learned!" There was a dreadful
time over learning to say <i>the</i> without making
a buzzing sound; even mastering the v's and
w's was not so hard as that. It was indeed a
proud day for Mary Antin when she could say
"We went to the village after water," to her
teacher's satisfaction.</p>

<p>How Mary Antin loved the American speech!
She had a native gift for language, and gathered
the phrases eagerly, lovingly, as one
gathers flowers, ever reaching for more and
still more. She said the words over and over
to herself with shining eyes as the miser counts
his gold. Soon she found that she was thinking
in the beautiful English way. When she had
been only four months at school she wrote a
composition on <i>Snow</i> that her teacher had
printed in a school journal to show this foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
child's wonderful progress in the use of the new
tongue. Here is a bit of that composition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now the trees are bare, and no flowers are to see in the
fields and gardens (we all know why), and the whole world
seems like a-sleep without the happy bird songs which
left us till spring. But the snow which drove away all
these pretty and happy things, try (as I think) not to
make us at all unhappy; they covered up the branches of
the trees, the fields, the gardens and houses, and the whole
world looks like dressed in a beautiful white&mdash;instead of
green&mdash;dress, with the sky looking down on it with a
pale face....</p></blockquote>

<p>At the middle of the year the child who had
entered the primer class in September without
a word of English was promoted to the fifth
grade. She was indeed a proud girl when she
went home with her big geography book making
a broad foundation for all the rest of the pile,
which she loved to carry back and forth just
because it made her happy and proud to be
seen in company with books.</p>

<p>"Look at that pale, hollow-chested girl with
that load of books," said a kindly passer-by one
day. "It is a shame the way children are overworked
in school these days."</p>

<p>The child in question, however, would have
had no basis for understanding the chance sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
had she overheard the words. Her books
were her dearest joy. They were indeed in a
very real sense her only tangible possessions.
All else was as yet "the stuff that dreams
are made of." As she walked through the
dingy, sordid streets her glorified eyes looked
past the glimpses of unlovely life about her into
a beautiful world of her own. If she felt any
weight from the books she carried it was just
a comfortable reminder that this new Mary Antin
and the new life of glorious opportunity
were real.</p>

<p>When she climbed the two flights of stairs
to her wretched tenement her soul was not soiled
by the dirt and squalor through which she
passed. As she eagerly read, not only her
school history but also every book she could find
in the public library about the heroes of America,
she did not see the moldy paper hanging in
shreds from the walls or the grimy bricks of
the neighboring factory that shut out the sunlight.
Her look was for the things beyond the
moment&mdash;the things that really mattered. How
could the child feel poor and deprived when she
knew that the city of Boston was hers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
As she walked every afternoon past the fine,
dignified buildings and churches that flanked
Copley Square to the imposing granite structure
that held all her hero books, she walked as
a princess into her palace. Could she not read
for herself the inscription at the entrance:
Public Library&mdash;Built by the People&mdash;Free to
All&mdash;? Now she stood and looked about her
and said, "This is real. This all belongs to
these wide-awake children, these fine women,
these learned men&mdash;and to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Every nook of the library that was open to
the public became familiar to her; her eyes
studied lovingly every painting and bit of mosaic.
She spent hours pondering the vivid pictures
by Abbey that tell in color the mystic story
of Sir Galahad and the quest of the Holy Grail,
and it seemed as if the spirit of all romance
was hers. She lingered in the gallery before
Sargent's pictures of the "Prophets," and it
seemed as if the spirit of all the beautiful Sabbaths
of her childhood stirred within her, as
echoes of the Hebrew psalms awoke in her
memory.</p>

  Mary Antin
</div></div>

<p>When she went into the vast reading-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
she always chose a place at the end where, looking
up from her books, she could get the effect
of the whole vista of splendid arches and earnest
readers. It was in the courtyard, however, that
she felt the keenest joy. Here the child born
in the prison of the Pale realized to the full the
glorious freedom that was hers.</p>

<p>"The courtyard was my sky-roofed chamber
of dreams," she said. "Slowly strolling past
the endless pillars of the colonnade, the fountain
murmured in my ear of all the beautiful
things in all the beautiful world. Here I liked
to remind myself of Polotzk, the better to bring
out the wonder of my life. That I who was
brought up to my teens almost without a book
should be set down in the midst of all the books
that ever were written was a miracle as great
as any on record. That an outcast should become
a privileged citizen, that a beggar should
dwell in a palace&mdash;this was a romance more
thrilling than poet ever sung. Surely I was
rocked in an enchanted cradle."</p>

<p>As Mary Antin's afternoons were made glorious
by these visits to the public library, so her
nights were lightened by rare half-hours on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
South Boston Bridge where it crosses the Old
Colony Railroad. As she looked down at the
maze of tracks and the winking red and green
signal lights, her soul leaped at the thought of
the complex world in which she lived and the
wonderful way in which it was ordered and controlled
by the mind of man. Years afterward
in telling about her dreams on the bridge she
said:</p>

<p>"Then the blackness below me was split by
the fiery eye of a monster engine, his breath
enveloped me in blinding clouds, his long body
shot by, rattling a hundred claws of steel, and
he was gone. So would I be, swift on my rightful
business, picking out my proper track from
the million that cross it, pausing for no obstacles,
sure of my goal."</p>

<p>Can you imagine how the child from Polotzk
loved the land that had taken her to itself? As
she stood up in school with the other children
and saluted the Stars and Stripes, the words
she said seemed to come from the depths of her
soul: "I pledge allegiance to my flag and to
the Republic for which it stands&mdash;one nation
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Those were not words, they were heart throbs.
The red of the flag was not just a bright color,
it was the courage of heroes; the white was the
symbol of truth clear as the sunlight; the blue
was the symbol of the wide, free heavens&mdash;her
spirit's fatherland. The child who had been
born in prison, who had repeated at every Passover,
"Next year, may we be in Jerusalem,"
had found all at once her true country, her flag,
and her heroes. When the children rose to sing
"America," she sang with all the pent-up feeling
of starved years of exile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">I love thy rocks and rills,</div>
<div class="line">Thy woods and templed hills.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">As the teacher looked into the glorified face
of this little alien-citizen she said to herself,
"There is the truest patriot of them all!"</p>

<p>Only once as they were singing "Land where
my fathers died," the child's voice had faltered
and died away. Her cheek paled when at the
close of school she came to her teacher with her
trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, teacher," she mourned, "our country's
song can't to mean me&mdash;<i>my</i> fathers didn't die
here!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
The friendly teacher, whose understanding
and sympathy were never failing, understood
now:</p>

<p>"Mary Antin," she said earnestly, looking
through the child's great, dark eyes into the
depths of her troubled soul, "you have as much
right to those words as I or anybody else in
America. The Pilgrim Fathers didn't all
come here before the Revolution. Isn't your
father just like them? Think of it, dear, how
he left his home and came to a strange land
where he couldn't even speak the language.
And didn't he come looking for the same
things? He wanted freedom for himself and
his family, and a chance for his children to
grow up wise and brave. It's the same story
over again. Every ship that brings people
from Russia and other countries where they are
ill-treated is a <i class="ship">Mayflower</i>!"</p>

<p>These words took root in Mary Antin's heart
and grew with her growth. The consciousness
that she was in very truth an American glorified
her days; it meant freedom from every
prison. Seven years after her first appearance
in the Boston primer class she entered Barnard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
College. After two years there and two more
at Teachers College, she entered the school of
life as a homemaker; her name is now Mary
Antin Grabau. Besides caring for her home
and her little daughter, she has devoted her
gifts as a writer and a lecturer to the service of
her country.</p>

<p>In her book, "The Promised Land," she has
told the story of her life from the earliest memories
of her childhood in Russia to the time
when she entered college. It is an absorbing
human story, but it is much more than that.
It is the story of one who looks upon her American
citizenship as a great "spiritual adventure,"
and who strives to quicken in others a
sense of their opportunities and responsibilities
as heirs of the new freedom. She pleads for a
generous treatment of all those whom oppression
and privation send to make their homes in
our land. It is only by being faithful to the
ideal of human brotherhood expressed in the
Declaration of Independence that our nation
can realize its true destiny, she warns us.</p>

<p>Mary Antin was recently urged to write a
history of the United States for children, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
would give the inner meaning of the facts as
well as a clear account of the really significant
events.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have long had such a work in mind," she wrote, "and
I suppose I shall have to do it some day. In the meantime
I <i>talk</i> history to my children&mdash;my little daughter of
eight and the Russian cousin who goes to school in the
kitchen. Only yesterday at luncheon I told them about
our system of representative government, and our potatoes
grew cold on our plates, we were all so absorbed."</p></blockquote>

<p>In all that Mary Antin writes and in all that
she says her faith in her country and her zeal
for its honor shine out above all else. To the
new pilgrims who lived and suffered in other
lands before they sought refuge in America, as
well as to those who can say quite literally,
"Land where my fathers died," she brings this
message:</p>

<p>"We must strive to be worthy of our great
heritage as American citizens so that we may
use wisely and well its wonderful privileges.
To be alive in America is to ride on the central
current of the river of modern life; and to have
a conscious purpose is to hold the rudder that
steers the ship of fate."</p>

<h2>A CAMPFIRE INTERPRETER</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmin"> GREAT</span> poet once tried to look into the
future and picture the kind of people
who might some day live upon the earth&mdash;people
wiser and happier than we are because they
shall have learned through our mistakes and
carried to success our beginnings, and so have
come to understand fully many things that we
see dimly as through a mist. These people
Tennyson calls the "crowning race":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">Of those that eye to eye shall look</div>
<div class="line">On knowledge; under whose command</div>
<div class="line">Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand</div>
<div class="line">Is Nature like an open book.</div>
</div></div>

<p>You see he believed that the way to gain
command of Earth is through learning to read
the open book of Nature. That book is closed
to most of us to-day, but we are just beginning
to spell out something of its message, and as
we begin to understand we feel that it is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
strange speech but our own true mother tongue,
which ears, deafened by the noise of the busy
world, have almost ceased to hear and understand.
There comes a time, however, when we
feel "the call of the wild." We long to get
away from the hoarse cries of engines, and the
grinding roar of turning wheels, to a quiet that
is unbroken even by a passing motor horn.</p>

<p>Have you ever found yourself for a happy
half-hour alone among the great trees of the
friendly woods? You must have felt that in
getting near to Nature you were finding yourself.
Did not the life of the trees, of the winged
creatures of the branches, of the cool mossy
ground itself, seem a part of your life?</p>

<p>Have you ever climbed a hill when it seemed
that the wind was blowing something of its own
strength and freshness into your soul? Did
you not feel as if you were mounting higher and
higher into the air and lifting the sky with you?
Have you ever found yourself at evening in a
great clear open place where the tent of the
starry heavens over your head seemed nearer
than the shadowy earth and all the things of the
day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
This is the story of a girl who loved to listen
to the deep chant of the ocean, to the whisper
of the wind in the trees, and to the silence in
the heart of the hills. She came to feel that
there was a joy and a power in the open&mdash;in the
big, free, unspoiled haunts of furtive beasts and
darting birds&mdash;that all the man-made wonders
of the world could not give.</p>

<p>"If I am so much happier and more alive,"
she said to herself, "in the days that I spend
under the open sky, what must it be like <i>always</i>
to live this freer life? Did not the people who
lived as Nature's own children in these very
woods that I come to as the guest of an hour
or a summer, have a wisdom and a strength
that our life to-day cannot win?"</p>

<p>Again and again the thought came knocking
at her heart: "The men whom we call savages,
whom we have crowded out of the land they
once roamed over freely, must have learned
very much in all the hundreds of years that
they lived close to Nature. They could teach
us a great deal that cannot be found in books."</p>

<p>Alice C. Fletcher grew up in a cultured New
England home. She had the freedom of a generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
library and early learned to feel that
great books and wise men were familiar friends.
They talked to her kindly and never frightened
her by their big words and learned looks. She
looked through the veil of words to the living
meaning.</p>

<p>She was, too, very fond of music. Playing
the piano was more than practising an elegant
accomplishment&mdash;just as reading her books was
more than learning lessons. As the books
stirred her mind to thinking and wondering, so
the music stirred her heart to feeling and
dreaming.</p>

<p>It often seemed, however, that much that her
books and music struggled in vain to bring to
her within walls was quite clear when she found
herself in the large freedom of Nature's house.
The sunshine, the blue sky, and the good, wholesome
smell of the brown earth seemed to give a
taste of the</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health,</div>
<div class="line">Truth breathed by cheerfulness.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Once in her reading she came upon the story
of the scholar who left Oxford and the paths
of learning to follow the ways of the wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
gypsies in order that he might learn the natural
wisdom they had won. "Ah," she said to herself,
"some day when I am free to live my life
in my own way I shall leave my books and go
out among the Indians. Our country should
know what its first children saw and thought and
felt. I shall try to see with their eyes and
hear with their ears for a while and I shall
discover, in that way, perhaps, a new world&mdash;one
that will be lost forever when the Red Men
are made to adopt all the tricks and manners
of civilized life."</p>

<p>The time came when she found herself free
to realize this dream.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you are really going
to live with the Indians?" her friends exclaimed.</p>

<p>"How else can I know them?" she replied
quietly.</p>

<p>"But to give up every necessary comfort!"</p>

<p>"There is something perhaps better than just
making sure that we are always quite comfortable,"
said Miss Fletcher. "Of course, I shall
miss easy chairs and cozy chats, and all the
lectures, concerts, latest books, and daily papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
but I'm glad to find out that all these nice
things are not really so <i>necessary</i> that they can
keep me from doing a bit of work that is really
worth while, and which, perhaps, needs just
what I can bring to it."</p>

<p>At this time Miss Fletcher's earnest, thoughtful
studies of what books and museums could
teach about the early history of America and
the interesting time before history, had given
her a recognized place among the foremost
scholars of archeology&mdash;the science that reads
the story of the forgotten past through the
relics that time has spared.</p>

<p>"Many people can be found to study the
things about the Indians which can be collected
and put in museums," said Miss Fletcher, "but
there is need of a patient, sympathetic study
of the people themselves."</p>

<p>In order to make this study, she spent not
only months but years among the Dakota and
Omaha Indians. From a wigwam made of buffalo
skins she watched the play of the children
and the life of the people and listened to their
songs and stories.</p>

<p>"The Indian is not the stern, unbending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
wooden Indian that shows neither interest nor
feeling of any sort, as many people have come
to think of him," said Miss Fletcher. "Those
who picture him so have never really known
him. They have only seen the side he turns
toward strangers. In the home and among
their friends the Indians show fun, happy give-and-take,
and warm, alert interest in the life
about them."</p>

<p>The cultivated New England woman and distinguished
scholar won their confidence because
of her sincerity, tact, and warm human sympathy.
She not only learned their speech and
manners but also the language of their hearts.
Her love of Nature helped her to a ready understanding
of these children of Nature or Wakonda&mdash;as
they called the spirit of life that
breathes through earth and sky, rocks, streams,
plants, all living creatures, and the tribes of
men. The beautiful ceremony by which, soon
after his birth, each Omaha child was presented
to the powers of Nature showed this sense of
kinship between the people and their world.
A priest of the tribe stood outside the wigwam
to which the new life had been sent, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
right hand outstretched to the heavens chanted
these words in a loud voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">Ho, ye Sun, Moon, Stars, all ye that move in the heavens,</div>
<div class="indent2">I bid ye hear me!</div>
<div class="line">Into your midst has come a new life;</div>
<div class="indent2">Consent ye, I implore!</div>
<div class="line">Make its path smooth, that it may reach</div>
<div class="indent2">The brow of the first hill.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Next the forces of the air&mdash;winds, clouds,
mist, and rain&mdash;were called upon to receive the
young child and smooth the path to the second
hill. Then hills, valleys, rivers, lakes, trees,
and all growing things were invoked, after
which the spirits of birds, animals, and all moving
creatures were summoned to make the path
smooth to the third and fourth hills. As the
priest intoned the noble appeal to all the powers
of the earth and air and bending heavens, even
those who could not understand the words
would know that the four hills meant childhood,
youth, manhood, and age, and that a new life
was being presented to the forces of the universe
of which it was a part. So it was that
each child was thought of as belonging to
Wakonda&mdash;to the spirit of all life&mdash;before he
belonged to the tribe. For it was not until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
was four or five years old that he gave up his
"baby name," such as Bright Eyes, Little Bird,
or Baby Squirrel, and was given a real name
and received into the life of the people.</p>

<p>Miss Fletcher soon became interested in the
music of the Indians. Her trained ear told her
that here was something new. The haunting
bits of melody and strange turns of rhythm
were quite different from any old-world tunes.</p>

<p>"At first it was very hard to hear them," said
Miss Fletcher. "The Indians never sang to be
heard by others. Their singing was a spontaneous
expression of their feeling&mdash;for the
most part, religious feeling. In their religious
ceremonies the noise of the dancing and of the
drums and rattles often made it very hard to
really catch the sound of the voice."</p>

<p>Day after day she strove to hear and write
down bits of the music, but it was almost like
trying to imprison the sound of the wind in the
tree-tops.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," said Miss Fletcher,
"how the old Saxon poet tried to explain the
mystery of life by saying it was like a bird flying
through the windows of a lighted hall out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
of the darkness to darkness again? An Indian
melody is like that. It has no preparations, no
beginning. It flashes upon you and is gone,
leaving only a teasing memory behind."</p>

<p>While this lover of music was vainly trying
to catch these strangely beautiful strains of
melody, the unaccustomed hardships of her life
brought upon her a long illness. There was
compensation, however, for when she could no
longer go after the thing she sought it came
to her. Her Indian friends who had found out
that she was interested in their songs gathered
about her couch to sing them for her.</p>

<p>"So my illness was after all like many of
our so-called trials, a blessing in disguise,"
said Miss Fletcher. "I was left with this
lameness, but I had the music. The sigh had
become a song!"</p>

<p>You have, perhaps, heard of the great interest
that many learned people have in the
songs and stories of simple folk&mdash;the folk-songs
and folk-tales of different lands. Did
you know that Sir Walter Scott's first work in
literature was the gathering of the simple ballads
of the Scottish peasants which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
long repeated just as you repeat the words of
"ring games" learned from other children?</p>

<p>Did you know that most of the fairy stories
and hero tales that you love were told by people
who had never held a book in their hands,
and were repeated ages and ages ago before
the time of books? Just as it is true that
broad, flowing rivers have their source in
streams that well up out of the ground, so it is
true that the literature of every nation has its
source in the fancies that have welled up out
of the hearts and imaginations of the simple
people. The same thing is true of music.
Great composers like Brahms and Liszt took
the wild airs of the Hungarian gypsies and
made them into splendid compositions that all
the world applauds. Chopin has done this with
the songs of the simple Polish folk. Dvorák,
the great Bohemian composer, has made his
"New World Symphony" of negro melodies,
and Cadman and others are using the native
Indian music in the same way.</p>

<p>Just as the Grimm brothers went about
among the German peasants to learn their interesting
stories, just as Sir George Dasent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
worked to get the tales of the Norse, so Alice
Cunningham Fletcher worked to preserve the
songs and stories of the Indians. Others have
come after her and have gone on with the work
she began, following the trail she blazed. All
musicians agree that this native song with its
fascinating and original rhythms may prove
the source of inspiration for American composers
of genius and give rise to our truest new-world
music.</p>

<p>Much of Miss Fletcher's work is preserved in
great learned volumes, such as "The Omaha
Tribe," published by the National Government,
for she wrote as a scientist for those who will
carry on the torch of science into the future.
But realizing that the music would mean much
to many who cannot enter upon the problems
with which the wise men concern themselves,
she has presented many of the songs in a little
book called "Indian Story and Song." We
find there, for instance, the "Song of the
Laugh" sung when the brave young warrior
recounts the story of the way he has slain his
enemy with his own club and so helped to fill
with fear the foes of his tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
We find, too, the story of the youth who
begins his life as a man by a lonely vigil when
by fasting he proves his powers of endurance.</p>

<p>The Omaha tribal prayer is the solemn melody
that sounded through the forests of America
long before the white man came to this country&mdash;a
cry of the yearning human spirit to
Wakonda, the spirit of all life.</p>

<p>Try to picture Miss Fletcher surrounded by
her Indian friends, explaining to them carefully
all about the strange machine before which she
wants them to sing. For the graphophone was
a field worker with her&mdash;for a time her chief
assistant in catching the elusive Indian songs.
Perhaps there could have been no greater proof
of their entire confidence in her than their willingness
to sing for her again and again, and
even to give into the keeping of her queer little
black cylinders the strains that voiced their
deepest and most sacred feelings. For Indian
music is, for the most part, an expression of
the bond between the human spirit and the unseen
powers of Nature. It must have been that
they felt from the first that here was some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
who understood them because she, too, loved
the Nature they knew and loved.</p>

<p>While Miss Fletcher was thus happily at
work she became aware, however, that there
was keen distress among these friends to whom
she had become warmly attached. Some of
their neighbors, the Ponca Indians, had been
removed from their lands to the dreaded "hot
country"&mdash;Indian Territory&mdash;and the Omaha
people feared that the same thing might happen
to them, for it was very easy for unprincipled
white men to take advantage of the
Indians who held their lands as a tribe, not as
individuals.</p>

<p>Always on the frontier of settlement there
were bold adventurers who coveted any promising
tracts of land that the Indians possessed.
They said to themselves, "We could use this
country to much better advantage than these
savages, therefore it should be ours." They
then would encroach more and more on the
holdings of the Indians, defying them by every
act which said plainly, "A Redskin has no
rights!" Sometimes when endurance could go
no further the Indians would rise up in active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
revolt. Then what more easy than to cry out,
"An Indian uprising! There will be a massacre!
Send troops to protect us from the mad
fury of the savages!" The Government would
then send a detachment of cavalry to quell the
outbreak, after which it would seem wiser to
move the Indians a little farther away from
contact with the white men, who now had just
what they had been working toward from the
first&mdash;the possession of the good land.</p>

<p>Miss Fletcher realized that the only remedy
for this condition was for each Indian to secure
from the Government a legal title to a portion
of the tribal grant which he might hold as an
individual. She left her happy work with the
music and went to Washington to explain to
the President and to Congress the situation as
she knew it. The cause was, at this time,
greatly furthered by the appearance of a book
by Helen Hunt Jackson, called "A Century of
Dishonor," an eloquent presentation of the Indians'
wrongs and a burning plea for justice.</p>

<p>There was need, however, of some practical
worker, who knew the Indians and Indian affairs
intimately, to point to a solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
problem. The conscience of the people was
aroused, but they did not know how it was possible
to prevent in the future the same sort of
wrongs that had made the past hundred years
indeed "a century of dishonor." Then the
resolute figure of Miss Alice Fletcher appeared
on the scene. She was well known to the government
authorities for her valuable scientific
work. Here was some one they knew, who
really could explain the exact state of affairs
and who could also interpret fairly the mind of
the Indian. She could be depended on as one
who would not be swayed by mere sentimental
considerations. She would know the practical
course to pursue.</p>

<p>"Let the Indians hold their land as the white
men hold theirs," she said. "That is the only
way to protect them from wrong and to protect
the Government from being a helpless partner
to the injustice that is done them."</p>

</div></div>

<p>Now, it is one thing to influence people who
are informed and interested and quite another
to awaken the interest of those who are vitally
concerned with totally different things. Miss
Fletcher realized that if anything was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
actually accomplished she must leave no stone
unturned to bring the matter to the attention
of those who had not heretofore given a
thought to the Indian question and the responsibility
of the Government. She presented a
petition to Congress and worked early and late
to drive home to the people the urgent need of
legislation in behalf of the Indians. She spoke
in clubs, in churches, in private houses, and
before committees in Congress. And actually
the busy congressmen who always feel that
there is not half time enough to consider measures
by which their own States and districts
will profit, gave right of way to the Indian
Land Act, and in 1882 it became a law.</p>

<p>There was the need of the services of some
disinterested person to manage the difficult
matter of dividing the tribal tracts and allotting
to each Indian his own acres, and Miss
Fletcher was asked by the President to undertake
this work.</p>

<p>"Why do you trust Miss Fletcher above any
one else?" asked President Cleveland on one
occasion when he was receiving a delegation of
Omahas at the White House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
"We have seen her in our homes; we have
seen her in her home. We find her always the
same," was the reply.</p>

<p>The work which Miss Fletcher did in allotting
the land to the Omahas was so successfully
handled that she was appealed to by the Government
to serve in the same capacity for the
Winnebago and Nez Percé Indians. The law
whose passage was secured by her zeal was the
forerunner the Severalty Act of 1885 which
marked a change in policy of the Government
and ushered in a better era for all the Indian
tribes.</p>

<p>"What led you to undertake this important
work?" Miss Fletcher was asked.</p>

<p>"The most natural desire in the world&mdash;the
impulse to help my friends where I saw the
need," she replied. "I did not set out resolved
to have a career&mdash;to form and to reform.
There is no story in my life. It has always
been just one step at a time&mdash;one thing which
I have tried to do as well as I could and which
has led on to something else. It has all been
in the day's work."</p>

<p>Miss Fletcher has been much interested in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the work of the Boy and Girl Scouts and in the
Campfire Societies, because she feels that in
this way many children are brought to an appreciation
of the great out-of-doors and win
health, power, and joy which the life of cities
cannot give. For them she has made a collection
of Indian games and dances.</p>

<p>"Just as the spirit of Sir Walter Scott
guides us through the Scottish lake country
and as Dickens leads us about old London, so
the spirit of the Indians should make us more
at home in the forests of America," said Miss
Fletcher. "In sharing the happy fancies of
these first children of America we may win a
new freedom in our possession of the playground
of the great out-of-doors."</p>

<h2>THE "WHITE MOTHER" OF DARKEST AFRICA</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="dropleftmid">MONG</span> all the weavers in the great factory
at Dundee there was no girl more deft and
skilful than Mary Slessor. She was only eleven
when she had to help shoulder the cares of the
household and share with the frail mother the
task of earning bread for the hungry children.
For the little family was worse than fatherless.
The man who had once been a thrifty, self-respecting
shoemaker had become a slave to drink;
and his life was a burden to himself and to
those who were nearest and dearest to him.</p>

<p>"Dinna cry, mither dear," Mary had said.
"I can go to the mills in the morning and to
school in the afternoon. It will be a glad day,
earning and learning at the same time!"</p>

<p>So Mary became a "half-timer" in the mills.
At six o'clock every morning she was at work
among the big whirling wheels. Even the walls
and windows seemed to turn sometimes as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
hot wind came in her face from the whizzing
belts, and the roar of the giant wheels filled all
her day with din and clamor.</p>

<p>But as Mary worked week after week, she
learned more than the trick of handling the
shuttle at the moving loom. She learned how
to send her thoughts far away from the noisy
factory to a still place of breeze-stirred trees
and golden sunshine. Sometimes a book, which
she had placed on the loom to peep in at free
moments, helped her to slip away in fancy from
the grinding toil. What magic one could find in
the wonderful world of books! The wheels
whirled off into nothingness, the walls melted
away like mist, and her spirit was free to wander
through all the many ways of the wide
world. And so it was that she went from the
hours of work and earning to the hours of study
and learning with a blithe, morning face, her
brave soul shining through bright eager eyes.</p>

<p>"When we're all dragged out, and feel like
grumbling at everything and nothing seems of
any use at all, Mary Slessor is still up and coming,
as happy as a cricket," said one of the girls
who worked by her side. "She makes you take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
heart in spite of yourself, and think it's something
to be glad over just to be living and working."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful the way your hand can go
on with the shuttle and do the turn even better
than you could if you stopped to take thought,"
Mary would explain. "That leaves your mind
free to go another way. Now this morning I
was not in the weaving shed at all; I was far
away in Africa, seeing all the strange sights the
missionary from Calabar told us about last
night at meeting."</p>

<p>Heaven was very near to Mary Slessor, and
the stars seemed more real than the street
lamps of the town. She had come to feel that
the troubles and trials of her days were just
steps on the path that she would travel. Always
she looked past the rough road to the end
of the journey where there was welcome in the
Father's house for all His tired children.
There was, moreover, one bit of real romance
in that gray Scotch world of hers. The thrill
of beauty and mystery and splendid heroism
was in the stories that the missionaries told of
Africa, the land of tropical wonders&mdash;pathless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
forests, winding rivers under bending trees,
bright birds, and brighter flowers&mdash;and people,
hundreds of black people, with black lives because
the light of truth had never shone in their
world. She knew that white people who called
themselves Christians had gone there to carry
them away for slaves; and to get their palm-oil
and rubber and give them rum in exchange&mdash;rum
that was making them worse than the wild
beasts of the jungle. How Mary Slessor longed
to be one to carry the good news of a God of
Love to those people who lived and died in darkness!
"Somebody must help those who can't
help themselves!" she said to herself.</p>

<p>"The fields are ripe for the harvest but the
laborers are few," one of the missionaries had
said. "We fear the fever and other ills that
hide in the bush more than we fear to fail in
God's service. Men have gone to these people
to make money from the products of their land;
they have bought and sold the gifts of their
trees; they have bought and sold the people
themselves; they are selling them death to-day
in the strong drink they send there. Is there
no one who is willing to go to take life to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
ignorant children who have suffered so many
wrongs?"</p>

<p>These words sank deep into Mary Slessor's
heart. But it was plain that her mission was
to the little home in Dundee. She was working
now among the turning wheels all day from six
until six, and going to school in the evening;
but she found time to share with others the secret
of the joy that she had found, the light that
had made the days of toil bright. The boys
that came to her class in the mission school
were "toughs" from the slums of the town,
but she put many of them on the road to useful,
happy living. Her brave spirit won them
from their fierce lawlessness; her patience and
understanding helped to bring out and fortify
the best that was in them.</p>

<p>Once a much-dreaded "gang" tried to break
up the mission with a battery of mud and jeers.
When Mary Slessor faced them quietly, the
leader, boldly confronting her, swung a leaden
weight which hung suspended from a cord,
about her head threateningly. It came nearer
and nearer until it grazed her temple, but the
mission teacher never flinched. Her eyes still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
looked into those of the boy's&mdash;bright, untroubled,
and searching. His own dropped,
and the missile fell forgotten to the ground.</p>

<p>"She's game, boys!" he cried, surprised out
of himself.</p>

<p>And the unruly mob filed into the mission to
hear what the "game" lady had to say. Mary
Slessor had never heard of the poet, Horace;
but she had put to the proof the truth of the
well-known lines, which declare that "the man
whose life is blameless and free from evil has
no need of Moorish javelins, nor bow, nor
quiver full of poisoned arrows."</p>

<p>As in her work with the wild boys of the
streets, so in her visits to the hopeless people
of the dark tenements, Mary Slessor was a powerful
influence because she entered their world
as one of them, with a faith in the better self of
each that called into new life his all-but-extinguished
longing for better things.</p>

<p>"As she sat by the fire holding the baby and
talking cheerily about her days at the mills
and the Sabbath morning at chapel, it seemed
as if I were a girl again, happy and hopeful and
ready to meet whatever the morrow might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
bring," said a discouraged mother to whom
Mary had been a friend in need.</p>

<p>"It is like hearing the kirk-bells on a Sunday
morning at the old home, hearing your voice,
Mary Slessor," said a poor blind woman to
whom Mary had brought the light of restored
faith.</p>

<p>For fourteen years this happy Scotch girl
worked in the factory for ten hours each day,
and shared her evenings and Sundays with her
neighbors of the mission. Besides, she seized
moments by the way for study and reading.
Her mind was hungry to understand the meaning
of life and the truths of religion. One day,
in order to find out the sort of mental food she
craved, a friend lent her Carlyle's "Sartor Resartus."</p>

<p>"How are you and Carlyle getting on together?"
he asked quizzically when they next
met.</p>

<p>"It is grand!" she replied with earnest enthusiasm.
"I sat up reading it, and was so
interested that I did not know what the time
was until I heard the factory bells calling me
to work in the morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Thus her mind was growing and expanding,
while her spirit grew through faithful work
and loyal service. Her simple, direct speech
had an eloquent appeal that went straight to
the heart. In spite of an unconquerable timidity
that made her shrink from platform appearances,
her informal addresses had wide
influence. Once she rose in her place at a public
meeting and gave a quiet talk on the words:
<i>The common people heard him gladly.</i> "And,"
it was said, "the common people heard <i>her</i>
gladly, and crowded around, pleading with her
to come again."</p>

<p>In 1874, when every one was stirred by the
death of David Livingstone, Mary Slessor's
life was transfigured by a great resolve. The
years had brought changes. Her father was
dead, and her sisters were old enough to share
the burden of supporting the family.</p>

<p>"The time has come for me to join the band
of light-bearers to the Dark Continent," said
Mary, with a conviction that overcame every
obstacle. "It is my duty to go where the laborers
are few. Besides, there must be a way to
work there and send help to mother at home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
She knew that the missionaries were given a
stipend to support them in the manner of the
country from which they came. "I shall as
far as possible live on the food of the country,"
she said. "It may be that by sharing to a
greater extent the conditions of life of the people,
I can come to a fuller understanding of
them and they of me. Besides, it will not be
so hard to leave home if I can feel that I am
still earning something for mother."</p>

<p>So Mary Slessor went, after a few months of
special preparation to teach the natives of Calabar.
She was at this time twenty-eight years
old. Ever since she was a mere slip of a girl,
she had longed to serve in that most discouraging
of fields&mdash;"the slums of Africa," it
was called. The people who inhabited that
swampy, equatorial region were the most
wretched and degraded of all the negro tribes.
They had for ages been the victims of stronger
neighbors, who drove them back from the drier
and more desirable territory that lay farther
inland; and of their own ignorance and superstitions,
which were at the root of their blood-thirsty,
savage customs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
It was in September, 1876, that the vessel
<i class="ship">Ethiopia</i> sailed out of the clean, blue Atlantic
into the mud-colored Calabar River. At its
prow stood Mary Slessor, gazing soberly at the
vast mangrove swamps and wondering about
the unknown, unexplored land beyond, where
she should pitch her tent and begin her work.
Though white men had for centuries come to
the coast to trade for gold dust, ivory, palm oil,
spices, and slaves, they had never ventured inland,
and the natives who lived near the shore
had sought to keep the lion's share of the profit
by preventing the remoter tribes from coming
with their goods to barter directly with the men
of the big ships. So only a few miles from the
mouth of the Calabar River was a land where
white people had never gone, whose inhabitants
had never seen a white face. It was to this
place of unknown dangers that Mary Slessor
was bound.</p>

<p>For a time she remained at the mission settlement
to learn the language, while teaching
in the day school. As soon as she gained sufficient
ease in the use of the native speech, she
began to journey through the bush, as the tropical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
jungles of palms, bananas, ferns, and thick
grass were called. Her heart sang as she went
along, now wading through a spongy morass
bright with orchids, now jumping over a
stream or the twisted roots of a giant tree.
After the chill grayness of her Scottish country,
this land seemed at first a veritable paradise of
golden warmth, alluring sounds and scents, and
vivid color. Now she paused in delight as a
brilliant bird flashed through the branches
overhead; now she went on with buoyant step,
drinking in the tropical fragrance with every
breath. Surely so fair a land could not be so
deadly as it was said. She <i>must</i> keep well for
the task that lay before her. She could not
doubt that each day would bring strength for
the day's work.</p>

<p>With two or three of the boys from the Calabar
school as guides, she made the journey to
some of the out-districts. Here a white face
was a thing of wonder or terror. The children
ran away shrieking with fear; the women
pressed about her, chattering and feeling her
clothing and her face, to see if she were real.
At first she was startled, but she soon divined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
that this was just the beginning of friendly acquaintance.</p>

<p>Miss Slessor soon showed an astonishing
mastery of the language, and an even more
amazing comprehension of the minds of the
people. She realized that the natives were not
devoid of ideas and beliefs, but that, on the contrary,
certain crude conceptions, strongly
rooted through the custom and tradition of
ages, accounted for many of their horrible
practices. They put all twin babies to death
because they believed that one of them was a
demon-child whose presence in a tribe would
bring untold harm on the people. They tortured
and murdered helpless fellow creatures,
not wantonly, but because they believed that
their victims had been bewitching a suffering
chief&mdash;for disease was a mysterious blight,
caused by the "evil eye" of a malicious enemy.
When a chief died many people were slaughtered,
for of course he would want slaves and
companions in the world of spirits.</p>

<p>It was wonderful the way Mary Slessor was
able to move about among the rude, half-naked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
savages as confidently as she had among her
people in Scotland, looking past the dirt and
ugliness to the human heart beneath, tortured
by fear or grief, and say a word that brought
hope and comfort. She feared neither the
crouching beasts of the jungle nor the treacherous
tribes of the scattered mud villages.
Picking her way over the uncertain bush trails,
she carried medicine, tended the sick, and spoke
words of sympathy and cheer to the distressed.
Sometimes she stayed away over several nights,
when her lodging was a mud hut and her bed
a heap of unpleasant rags.</p>

<p>The people soon learned that her interest
went beyond teaching and preaching and giving
aid to the sick. She cared enough for their
welfare to lead them by night past the sentries
of the jealous coast tribes to the factory near
the beach, where they could dispose of their
palm oil and kernels to their own profit. She
won in this way the good will of the traders
who said:</p>

<p>"There is a missionary of the right sort!
She will accomplish something because she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
taking hold of all the problems that concern
her people, and is working systematically to improve
all the conditions of their lives."</p>

<p>One day she set forth on a trip of thirty miles
along the river to visit the village of a chief
named Okon, who had sent begging her to come.
A state canoe, which was lent by King Eyo of
Calabar, had been gaily painted in her honor,
and a canopy of matting to shield her from the
sun and dew had been thoughtfully erected over
a couch of rice bags. Hours passed in the tender
formalities of farewell, and when the paddlers
actually got the canoe out into the stream
it was quite dark. The red gleam of their
torches fell upon venomous snakes and alligators,
but there was no fear while her companions
beat the "tom-tom" and sang, as they
plied their paddles, loud songs in her praise,
such as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Ma, our beautiful, beloved mother is on board!</div>
<div class="indent6">Ho! Ho! Ho!"</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Such unwonted clamor no doubt struck terror
to all the creatures with claws and fangs along
the banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
After ten hours' paddling, she arrived at
Okon's village. A human skull stuck on a pole
was the first sight that greeted her. Crowds
gathered about to stare and touch her hand to
make sure that she was flesh and blood. At
meal times a favored few who were permitted
to watch her eat and drink ran about, excitedly
reporting every detail to their friends.</p>

<p>For days she went around giving medicines,
bandaging, cutting out garments, and teaching
the women the mysteries of sewing, washing,
and ironing. In the evenings all the people
gathered about her quietly while she told them
about the God she served&mdash;a God of love, whose
ways were peace and loving kindness. At the
end they filed by, wishing her good night with
much feeling before they disappeared into the
blackness of the night.</p>

<p>These new friends would not permit her to
walk about in the bush as she had been used to
doing. There were elephants in the neighboring
jungle, they said. The huge beasts had
trampled down all their growing things, so that
they had to depend mainly on fishing. One
morning, on hearing that a boa constrictor had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
been seen, bands of men armed with clubs and
muskets set off, yelling fearsomely, to hunt the
common enemy. But more terrible to Mary
Slessor than any beast of prey were the skulls,
horrible images, and offerings to ravenous
spirits, that she saw on every side. How was
it possible to teach the law of love to a people
who had never known anything but the tyranny
of fear?</p>

<p>"I must learn something of the patience of
the Creator of all," she said to herself again
and again. "For how long has He borne with
the sins and weakness of His poor human children,
always caring for us and believing that
we can grow into something better in spite of
all!"</p>

<p>After two weeks in "Elephant Country,"
Miss Slessor made ready to return to the mission.
Rowers, canoe, and baggage were in
readiness, and a smoking pot of yams and herbs
cooked in palm oil was put on board for the
evening meal. Scarcely had they partaken,
however, when Mary saw that the setting sun
was surrounded by angry clouds, and her ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
caught the ominous sound of the wind wailing
in the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"We are coming into a stormy night," she
said fearfully to Okon, who was courteously
escorting the party back to Old Town.</p>

<p>The chief lifted his black face to the black
sky and scanned the clouds solemnly. Then he
hastily steered for a point of land that lay
sheltered from the wind. Before they could
reach the lee side, however, the thunder broke,
and the wild sweep of the wind seized the
canoe and whirled it about like a paper toy.
Crew and chief alike were helpless from terror
when Mary took her own fear in hand and ordered
the rowers to make for the tangle of
trees that bordered the bank. The men pulled
together with renewed hope and strength until
the shelter of the bush was reached. Then
springing like monkeys into the overhanging
branches, they held on to the canoe which was
being dashed up and down like a straw. The
"White Mother," who was sitting in water to
her knees and shaking with ague, calmed the
fears of the panic-stricken children who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
buried their faces in her lap, and looked about
in awed wonder at the weird beauty of the
scene. The vivid flashes of lightning shattered
the darkness with each peal of thunder, revealing
luxuriant tropical vegetation rising above
the lashed water, foaming and hissing under the
slanting downpour of the rain, and the tossing
canoe with the crouching, gleaming-wet figures
of the frightened crew.</p>

<p>This was but one of many thrilling adventures
that filled the days of the brave young
missionary. When the appeal came, no matter
what the time of midday heat or midnight
blackness, she was ready to journey for hours
through the bush to bring succor and comfort.</p>

<p>Once the news came that the chief of a village
had been seized by a mysterious illness.
Knowing that this would mean torture, and
death, perhaps, to those suspected of having enviously
afflicted him by the "evil eye," she set
off along the trail through the dense forest to
use all her influence to save the unfortunate
victims.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;">

  Mary Slessor
</div></div>

<p>"But, Ma," the people would protest, "you
don't understand. If you god-people not punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
evil, bad ones say, 'God-ways no good!'
Bad ones go round cast spells with no fear.
No one safe at all."</p>

<p>Of all their superstitious fears, the horror of
twin babies was the most universal. With
great difficulty Miss Slessor managed to save a
few of these unfortunate infants. At first
some of the people refused to come into the
hut where a twin child was kept; but when they
saw that no plague attacked the place or the
rash white "Ma," they looked upon her with increased
respect. The "White Mother" must
have a power much greater than that of the
witch-doctors.</p>

<p>The witch-doctors knew a great deal, no
doubt. When a man had a tormented back they
could tell what enemy had put a spell on him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Ma, the witch-doctor he knows,"
declared a chief who was suffering with an abscess,
"just see all those claws, teeth, and bones
over there. He took them all out of my back."</p>

<p>But if "Ma" did not understand about such
spells, she had a wonderful magic of her own;
she knew soothing things to put on the bewitched
back that could drive the pain away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and make it well. The influence of the healer
was often stronger than the influence of the
witch-doctor and the superstitious fears of all
the tribe. Again and again her will prevailed
in the palaver, and the chief to please her
would spare the lives of those who should by
every custom of the land be put to death.</p>

<p>"Ma" required strange things of them, but
she was the best friend they had ever had.
When she stood up before them and spoke so
movingly it seemed as if she would talk the
heart right out of the sternest savage of them
all! She made them forget the things that they
had known all their lives. Who would have
believed that they would even dream of allowing
a chief's son to go unattended into the
spirit-world? Yet when she begged them to
spare the lives of the slaves who should have
been sent with him, they had at last consented.
And it didn't take a witch-doctor to tell one that
a twin-child should never be allowed to live and
work its demon spells in the world. Still they
allowed her to save some of them alive. It was
said that prudent people had even gone into the
room where the rescued twins were kept and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
had touched them without fear. They had been
almost persuaded that those queerly born babies
were just like other children!</p>

<p>The "White Mother" of Calabar always had
a family of little black waifs that she had rescued
from violent death or neglect. Besides
the unfortunate twins, there were the children
whose slave mothers had died when they were
tiny infants. "Nobody has time to bring up a
child that will belong to somebody else as soon
as it is good for something," it was said. So
the motherless children were left in the bush
to die.</p>

<p>Mary Slessor loved her strange black brood
tenderly. "Baby things are always gentle and
lovable," she used to say. "These children
who have had right training from the beginning
will grow up to be leaders and teachers of their
people."</p>

<p>For twelve years Miss Slessor worked in connection
with the established mission at Calabar,
journeying about to outlying villages as the
call came. It had for long been her dream,
however, to go still farther inland to the wild
Okoyong tribe whose very name was a terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
throughout the land. Her mother and her sister
Janie, who together made "home" for her,
had died.</p>

<p>"There is no one to write and tell all my
stories and troubles and nonsense to," she said.
"But Heaven is now nearer to me than Britain,
and nobody will be anxious about me if I go up
country."</p>

<p>In King Eyo's royal canoe she made the journey
to the strange people. Leaving the paddlers,
who were mortal enemies to the Okoyong
tribe, at the water's edge, she made her way
along the jungle trail to a village four miles
inland. Here the people crowded about her
greatly excited. They called her "Mother,"
and seemed pleased that she had come to them
without fear. The chief, Edem, and his sister,
Ma Eame, received her in a friendly fashion.
Her courage, frankness, and ready understanding
won favor from the beginning.</p>

<p>"May I have ground for a schoolhouse and
a home with you here?" she asked. "Will you
have me stay as your friend and help you as I
have helped the people of Calabar?"</p>

<p>Eagerly they assented. It would be a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
thing to have a "White Mother" in their country.</p>

<p>"Will you grant that the house I build shall
be a place of refuge for those in distress&mdash;for
those charged with witchcraft or threatened
with death for any other cause? Will you
promise that they shall be safe with me until
we can consider together their case?"</p>

<p>The people looked at the strange white woman
wonderingly. Why should she ask this
thing? What difference could it make to her?</p>

<p>"All life is precious," she said simply, as if
she had read their thoughts. "I am here to
help you&mdash;to care for those who are sick or
hurt, and I must be allowed to see that each
one who is in any sort of trouble is treated
fairly. Will you promise that my house shall
be a place of refuge?"</p>

<p>Again they gravely assented. So, greatly
encouraged, she returned to Calabar to pack
her goods and prepare to leave the old field for
the new.</p>

<p>All her friends gathered about her, loudly
lamenting. She was surely going to her death,
they said. Her fellow workers regarded her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
with wonder and pity. "Nothing can make
any impression on the Okoyong save a consul
and a British gunboat," they declared. But
Mary Slessor was undaunted. She stowed her
boxes and her little family of five small waifs
away in the canoe as happily as if she were
starting out on a pleasure trip. To a friend in
Scotland, she wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am going to a new tribe up-country, a fierce, cruel people,
and every one tells me that they will kill me. But I
don't fear any hurt&mdash;only to combat their savage customs
will require courage and firmness on my part.</p></blockquote>

<p>The life in Okoyong did indeed require
fortitude and faith. Remote from friends and
helpers, in the midst of that most dreaded of all
the African tribes, she patiently worked to
lighten the darkness of the degraded people and
make their lives happier and better. With her
rare gift of intuition she at once felt that Ma
Eame, the chief's sister, had a warm heart and
a strong character.</p>

<p>"She will be my chief ally," she said to herself,
and time proved that she was right. A
spark in the black woman's soul was quickened
by the White Mother's flaming zeal. Dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
she felt the power of the new law of love. Often
at the risk of her life, should she be discovered,
she kept the missionary informed in regard
to the movements of the people. Whether
it was a case of witchcraft or murder, of
vengeance or a raid on a neighboring tribe,
"Ma" was sure to find it out; and her influence
was frequently strong enough to avert a tragedy.</p>

<p>As at Calabar, she found that the greatest obstacle
in the way of progress was the general
indulgence in rum, which the white people gave
the natives in exchange for their palm oil,
spices, rubber, and other products.</p>

<p>"Do not drink the vile stuff&mdash;do not take it
or sell it," she begged. "It is like poison to
your body. It burns out your life and heart
and brings every trouble upon you."</p>

<p>"What for white man bring them rum suppose
them rum no be good?" they demanded.
"He be god-man bring the rum&mdash;then what for
god-man talk so?"</p>

<p>What was there to say? With a heavy heart
the White Mother struggled on to help her people
in spite of this great evil which men of the
Christian world had brought upon these weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
ignorant black children. And she did make
headway in spite of every discouragement. "I
had a lump in my throat often, and my courage
repeatedly threatened to take wings and fly
away&mdash;though nobody guessed it," she said.</p>

<p>For years this brave woman went on with her
work among the wild tribes of Nigeria. As
soon as she began to get the encouragement of
results in one place she pressed on to an unworked
field. Realizing that her pioneer work
needed to be reënforced and sustained by the
strong arm of the law, she persuaded the British
Government to "take up the white man's
burden" and (through the influence of consuls
and the persuasive presence of a gunboat or
two) assume the guardianship of her weak
children. In spite of failing health and the
discouragement of small results, she went from
one post to another, leaving mission houses and
chapel-huts as outward signs of the new life
to which she had been a witness. "I am ready
to go anywhere, provided it be forward," was
her watchword, as well as Dr. Livingstone's.</p>

<p>There are many striking points of likeness
between the careers of these two torch-bearers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
to the Dark Continent. As children both had
worked at the loom, studying hungrily as they
toiled. Both did pioneer work, winning the
confidence and love of the wild people they
taught and served. No missionary to Africa,
save Dr. Livingstone alone, has had a more
powerful influence than Mary Slessor.</p>

<p>When at last in January, 1915, after thirty-nine
years of service, she died and left to others
the task of bearing on the torch to her people,
Sir Frederick Lugard, the Governor-General
of Nigeria said:</p>

<p>"By her enthusiasm, self-sacrifice, and greatness
of character she has earned the devotion
of thousands of natives among whom she
worked, and the love and esteem of all Europeans,
irrespective of class or creed, with whom
she came in contact."</p>

<p>She was buried in the land to which she had
given her long life of service. At the grave
when the women, after the native fashion, began
their wild wail of lament, one of them lifted
up her voice in an exalted appeal that went
straight to the heart:</p>

<p>"Do not cry, do not cry! Praise God from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
whom all blessings flow. Ma was a great blessing."</p>

<p>Of all the words of glowing tribute to her
faithful work, we may be sure that none would
have meant more to the lowly missionary than
this cry from the awakened soul of one of her
people of the bush.</p>

<h2>THE HEROINE OF RADIUM</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="dropleftmin">OU</span> would hardly think that a big, bare
room, with rows of battered benches and
shelves and tables littered with all sorts of
queer-looking jars and bottles, could be a hiding-place
for fairies. Yet Marie's father, who was
one of the wise men of Warsaw, said they were
always to be found there.</p>

<p>"Yes, little daughter," he said, "the fairies
you may chance to meet with in the woods,
peeping from behind trees and sleeping in
flowers, are a tricksy, uncertain sort. The real
fairies, who do things, are to be found in my
dusty laboratory. They are the true wonder-workers,
and there you may really catch them
at work and learn some of their secrets."</p>

<p>"But, Father, wouldn't the fairies like it
better if it wasn't quite so dusty there?" asked
the child.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," replied the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
"We need one fairy more to put us to
rights."</p>

<p>At a time when most little girls are playing
with dolls, Marie was playing "fairy" in the
big classroom, dusting the tables and shelves,
and washing the glass tubes and other things
that her father used as he talked to his students.
"I think we might see the fairies better
if I make all these glasses clear and shiny,"
said Marie.</p>

<p>"Can I trust your little fingers not to let
things fall?" asked her father. "Remember,
my funny glasses are precious. It might cost
us a dinner if you should let one slip."</p>

<p>The professor soon found that his little
daughter never let anything slip&mdash;either the
things he used or the things he said. "Such a
wise little fairy and such a busy one!" he
would say. "I don't know how we could do our
work without her."</p>

<p>If Professor Ladislaus Sklodowski had not
loved his laboratory teaching above all else, he
would have known that he was overworked.
As it was, he counted himself fortunate in being
able to serve Truth and to enlist others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
her service. For the professor's zeal was of
the kind that kindles enthusiasm. If you had
seen the faces of those Polish students as they
hung on his words and watched breathlessly the
result of an experiment, you would have known
that they, too, believed in the wonder-working
fairies.</p>

<p>It seems as if the Polish people have a greater
love and understanding of the unseen powers of
the world than is given to many other nations.
If you read the story of Poland's tragic struggles
against foes within and without until,
finally, the stronger surrounding countries&mdash;Germany,
Austria, and Russia&mdash;divided her
territory as spoil among themselves and she
ceased to exist as a distinct nation, you will understand
why her children have sought refuge
in the things of the spirit. They have in a
wonderful degree the courage that rises above
the most unfriendly circumstances and says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">One day with life and heart</div>
<div class="line">Is more than time enough to find a world.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Some of them, like Chopin and Paderewski,
have found a new world in music; others have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
found it in poetry and romance; and still others
in science. The child who dreamed of fairies
in her father's classroom was to discover the
greatest marvel of modern science&mdash;a discovery
that opened up a new world to the masters of
physics and chemistry of our day.</p>

<p>Marie's mother, who had herself been a
teacher, died when the child was very small;
and so it happened that the busy father had to
take sole care of her and make the laboratory
do duty as nursery and playroom. It was not
strange that the bright, thoughtful little girl
learned to love the things that were so dear to
her father's heart. Would he not rather buy
things for his work than have meat for dinner?
Did he not wear the same shabby kaftan (the
full Russian top-coat that looks like a dressing-gown)
year after year in order that he might
have material for important experiments?
Truth was, indeed, more than meat and the
love of learning more than raiment in that
home, and the little daughter drank in his enthusiasm
with the queer laboratory smells
which were her native air and the breath of
life to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
The time came when the child had to leave
this nursery to enter school, but always, when
the day's session was over, she went directly to
that other school where she listened fascinated
to all her father taught about the wonders of
the inner world of atoms and the mysterious
forces that make the visible world in which we
live. She still believed in fairies,&mdash;oh, yes!&mdash;but
now she knew their names. There were
the rainbow fairies&mdash;light-waves, that make all
the colors we see,&mdash;and many more our eyes
are not able to discover, but which we can capture
by interesting experiments. There were
sound-waves, too, and the marvelous forces we
call electricity, magnetism, and gravitation.
When she was nine years old, it was second nature
to care for her father's batteries, beakers,
and retorts, and to help prepare the apparatus
that was to be used in the demonstrations of the
coming day. The students marveled at the
child's skill and knowledge, and called her with
admiring affection "professorowna," (daughter-professor).</p>

<p>There was a world besides the wonderland
of the laboratory, of which Marie was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
aware. This was the world of fear, where the
powers of Russia ruled. In 1861 the Poles had
made a vain attempt to win their independence,
and when Marie was a little girl (she was born
in 1867), the authorities tried to stamp out any
further sparks of possible rebellion by adopting
unusually harsh measures. It was a crime
to speak the Polish language in the schools and
to talk of the old, happy days when Poland was
a nation. If any one was even suspected of
looking forward to a better time when the people
would not be persecuted by the police or
forced to bribe unprincipled officials for a
chance to conduct their business without interference,
he was carried off to the cruel, yellow-walled
prison near the citadel, and perhaps sent
to a life of exile in Siberia. Since knowledge
means independent thought and capacity for
leadership, the high schools and universities
were particularly under suspicion. Years afterward,
when Marie spoke of this reign of terror,
her eyes flashed and her lips were set in a
thin white line. Time did not make the memory
less vivid.</p>

<p>"Every corridor of my father's school had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
finger-posts pointing to Siberia!" she declared
dramatically.</p>

<p>When Marie was sixteen, she graduated
from the "gymnasium" for girls, receiving a
gold medal for excellence in mathematics and
sciences. In Russia, as in Germany, the gymnasium
corresponds to our high school, but also
covers some of the work of the first two years
of college. The name gymnasium signifies a
place where the mind is exercised and made
strong in preparation for the work of the universities.</p>

<p>The position as governess to the daughters
of a Russian nobleman was offered to the brilliant
girl with the sweet, serious eyes and gentle
voice. As it meant independence and a
chance to travel and learn the ways of the
world, Marie agreed to undertake the work.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time in her life, the young
Polish girl knew work that was not a labor of
love. Her pupils cared nothing for the things
that meant everything to her. How they loved
luxury and show and gay chatter! How indifferent
they were to truth that would make the
world wiser and happier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
"How strangely you look, Mademoiselle
Marie," said the little Countess Olga one day,
in the midst of her French lesson. "Your eyes
seem to see things far away."</p>

<p>Marie was truly looking past her pupils, past
the rich apartment, beyond Russia, into the
great world of opportunity for all earnest
workers. She had overheard something about
another plot among the students of Warsaw,
and knew that some of her father's pupils had
been put under arrest.</p>

<p>"Suppose they should try to make me testify
against my friends," said the girl to herself.
"I must leave Russia at once. My savings
will surely take me to Paris, and there I may
get a place as helper in one of the big laboratories,
where I can learn as I work."</p>

<p>The eyes that had been dark with fear an instant
before became bright with hope. Eagerly
she planned a disguise and a way to slip off the
very next night while the household was in the
midst of the excitement of a masquerade ball.</p>

<p>Everything went well, and in due time she
found her trembling self and her slender possessions
safely stowed away on a train that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
was moving rapidly toward the frontier and
freedom. No one gave a second thought to the
little elderly woman with gray hair and spectacles
who sat staring out of the window of her
compartment at the fields and trees rushing
by in the darkness and the starry heavens that
the train seemed to carry with it. Her plain,
black dress and veil seemed those of a self-respecting,
upper-class servant, who was perhaps
going to the bedside of a dying son.</p>

<p>"I feel almost as old as I look," Marie was
saying to herself. "But how can a girl who is
all alone in the world, with no one to know what
happens to her, help feeling old? Down in my
heart, though, I know that life is just beginning.
There is something waiting for me beyond the
blackness&mdash;something that needs just little
me."</p>

<p>It was a wonderful relief when the solitary
journey was over and the elderly disguise laid
aside. "Shall I ever feel really young again?"
said the girl, who was not quite twenty-four.
But not for a moment did she doubt that there
was work waiting for her in the big, unexplored
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
During those early days in Paris, Marie often
had reason to be grateful for the plain living
of her childhood that had made her independent
of creature comforts. Now she knew
actual want in her cold garret, furnished only
with a cot and chair, like a hermit's cell. She
lived, too, on hermit's fare&mdash;black bread and
milk. But even when it was so cold that
the milk was frozen,&mdash;cold comfort, indeed!&mdash;the
fire of her enthusiasm knew no chill. Day
after day she walked from laboratory to laboratory
begging to be given a chance as assistant,
but always with the same result. It was man's
work; why did she not look for a place in a milliner's
shop?</p>

<p>One day she renewed her appeal to Professor
Lippman in the Sorbonne research laboratories.
Something in the still, pale face and deep-set,
earnest eyes caught the attention of the
busy man. Perhaps this strange, determined
girl was starving! And besides, the crucibles
and test-tubes were truly in sad need of attention.
Grudgingly he bade her clean the various
accessories and care for the furnace. Her
deftness and skill in handling the materials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
and a practical suggestion that proved of value
in an important experiment, attracted the favorable
notice of the professor. He realized
that the slight girl with the foreign look and
accent, whom he had taken in out of an impulse
of pity, was likely to become one of his most
valuable helpers.</p>

<p>A new day dawned for the ambitious young
woman. While supporting herself by her laboratory
work, she completed in two years the
university course for a degree in mathematics,
and, two years later, she won a second degree
in physics and chemistry. In the meantime her
enthusiasm for science and her undaunted
courage in the face of difficulties and discouragements
attracted the admiration of a fellow-worker,
Pierre Curie, one of the most promising
of the younger professors.</p>

<p>"I love you, and we both love the same
things," he said one day. "Would it not
be happier to live and work together than
alone?"</p>

<p>And so began that wonderful partnership of
two great scientists, whose hard work and heroic
struggle, crowned at last by brilliant success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
has been an inspiration to earnest workers
the world over.</p>

<p>Madame Curie set up a little laboratory in
their apartment, and toiled over her experiments
at all hours. Her baby daughter was
often bathed and dressed in this workroom
among the test-tubes and the interesting fumes
of advanced research.</p>

<p>"Irene is as happy in the atmosphere of science
as her mother was," said Madame Curie
to one of her husband's brother-professors who
seemed surprised to find a crowing infant in a
laboratory. "And if I could afford the best
possible nurse, she could not take my place!
For my baby and I know the joy of living and
growing together with those we love."</p>

<p>What was the problem that the mother was
working over even while she sewed for her little
girl, or rocked her to sleep to the gentle
crooning of an old Polish folk-song whose melody
Chopin has wrought into one of his tenderest
nocturnes?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;">
  <img id="i_image280" src="images/image280.jpg" width="328" height="593" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption">Marie Sklodowska Curie
</div></div>

<p>The child who used to delight in experiments
with light-waves in her father's laboratory, was
interested in the strange glow which Prof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Becquerel had found that the substance known
as uranium gave off spontaneously. Like the
X-rays, this light passes through wood and
other bodies opaque to sunlight. Madame
Curie became deeply interested in the problem
of the nature of the Becquerel rays and their
wonderful properties, such as that of making
the air a conductor for electricity. One day
she discovered that pitchblende, the black mineral
from which uranium is extracted, was
more <i>radioactive</i> (that is, it gave off more powerful
rays) than the isolated substance itself,
and she came to the conclusion that there was
some other element in the ore which, could it
be extracted, would prove more valuable than
uranium.</p>

<p>With infinite patience and the skill of highly
trained specialists in both physics and chemistry,
Madame Curie and her husband worked
to obtain this unknown substance. At times
Pierre Curie all but lost heart at the seemingly
insurmountable obstacles in the way. "It cannot
be done!" he exclaimed one day, with a
groan. "Truly, 'Nature has buried Truth deep
in the bottom of the sea.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
"But man can dive, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cher ami</i>," said his wife,
with a heartening smile. "Think of the joy
when one comes up at last with the pearl&mdash;the
pearl of truth!"</p>

<p>At last their toil was rewarded, and <i>two</i> new
elements were separated from pitchblende&mdash;polonium,
so named by Madame Curie in honor of
her native Poland, and radium, the most marvelous
of all radioactive substances. A tiny pinch
of radium, which is a grayish white powder not
unlike coarse salt in appearance, gives out a
strange glow something like that of fireflies, but
bright enough to read by. Moreover, light and
heat are radiated by this magic element with no
apparent waste of its own amount or energy.
Radium can also make some other substances,
diamonds for instance, shine with a light like its
own, and it makes the air a conductor of electricity.
Its weird glow passes through bone almost
as readily as through tissue-paper or
through flesh, and it even penetrates an inch-thick
iron plate.</p>

<p>The Curies now woke to find not only Paris
but the world ringing with the fame of their discovery.
The modest workers wanted nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
however, but the chance to go on with their research.
You know how Tennyson makes the
aged Ulysses look forward even at the end of his
life to one more last voyage. The type of the
unconquerable human soul that ever presses on
to fresh achievement, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">All experience is an arch where-thro'</div>
<div class="line">Gleams that untravel'd world, whose margin fades</div>
<div class="line">Forever and forever when I move.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">So it was with Pierre Curie and his wife. Their
famous accomplishment opened a new world of
interesting possibilities, a world which they
longed above all things to explore.</p>

<p>Their one trouble was the difficulty of procuring
enough of the precious element they had
discovered to go on with their experiments.
Because radium is not only rare, but also exceedingly
hard to extract from the ore, it is a
hundred times more precious than pure gold.
It is said that five tons of pitchblende were
treated before a trifling pinch of the magic powder
was secured. It would take over two thousand
tons of the mineral to produce a pound of
radium. Moreover, it was not easy to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the ore, as practically all the known mines were
in Austria, and those in control wanted to profit
as much as possible by this chance.</p>

<p>"It does seem as if people might not stand in
the way of our obtaining the necessary material
to go on with our work," lamented Pierre
Curie. "What we discover belongs to the world&mdash;to
any one who can use it."</p>

<p>"We have passed other lions in the way.
This, too, we shall pass," said Madame Curie,
quietly.</p>

<p>They lived in a tiny house in an obscure suburb
of Paris, giving all that they possessed&mdash;the
modest income gained from teaching and
lecturing, their share of the Nobel prize of
$40,000, which, in 1903, was divided between
them and Professor Becquerel, together with all
their time and all their skill and knowledge, to
their work.</p>

<p>For recreation they went for walks in the
country with little Irene, often stopping for dinner
at quaint inns among the trees. On one
such evening, when Dr. Curie had just declined
the decoration of the Legion of Honor, because
it had "no bearing on his work," his small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
daughter climbed on his knee and slipped a red
geranium into his buttonhole, saying, with comical
solemnity: "You are now decorated with
the Legion of Honor. Pray, Monsieur, what do
you intend to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I like this emblem much better than a glittering
star on a bit of red ribbon, and I love the
hand that put it there," replied the father, his
face lighting up with one of his rare smiles.
"In this case I make no objection."</p>

<p>Other honors, which meant increased opportunity
for work, were quietly accepted. Pierre
Curie was elected to the French Academy&mdash;the
greatest honor his country can bestow on her
men of genius and achievement. Madame Curie
received the degree of Doctor of Physical Science,
and&mdash;a distinction shared with no other
woman&mdash;the position of special lecturer at the
Sorbonne, in Paris.</p>

<p>One day in 1906, when Dr. Curie, his mind intent
on an absorbing problem, was absent-mindedly
hurrying across a wet street, he slipped
and fell under a passing truck and was instantly
killed. When they attempted to break
the news to Madame Curie by telling her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
her husband had been hurt in an accident, she
looked past them with a white, set face, and repeated
over and over to herself, as if trying to
get her bearings in the new existence that
stretched blackly before her, "Pierre is dead;
Pierre is dead."</p>

<p>Now, as on that night when she was leaving
Russia for an unknown world, she saw a gleam
in the blackness&mdash;there was work to be done!
There was something waiting in the shadowy
future for her, something that she alone could
do. As on that other night, she found her lips
shaping the words: "The big world has need
of little me. But oh, it will be hard now to
work alone!" Then her eyes fell on her two
little girls (Irene was now eight years old and
baby Eve was three), who were standing quietly
near with big, wondering eyes fixed on their
mother's strange face.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, darlings!" she cried, gathering
her children into her arms. "We must try hard
to go on with the work Father loved. <i>Together</i>
is a magic word for us still, little daughters!"</p>

<p>Everybody wondered at the courage and quiet
power with which Madame Curie went out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
meet her new life. She succeeded to her husband's
professorship, and carried on his special
lines of investigation as well as her own. The
value of her work to science and to humanity
may be indicated by the fact that in 1911 the
Nobel prize was again awarded to her&mdash;the only
time it has ever been given more than once to
the same person.</p>

<p>At home, she tried to be father as well as
mother. She took the children for walks in the
evening, and while she sewed on their dresses
and knitted them mittens and mufflers, she told
them stories of the wonderland of science.</p>

<p>"Why do you take time to write down everything
you do?" asked Eve one day, as she looked
over her mother's shoulder at the neat note-book
in which the world-famous scientist was summing
up the work of the day.</p>

<p>"Why does a seaman keep a log, dearie?" the
mother questioned with a smile. "A laboratory
is just like a ship, and I want things shipshape.
Every day with me is like a voyage&mdash;a voyage
of discovery."</p>

<p>"But why do you put question marks everywhere,
Mother!" persisted the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
It was true that the pages fairly bristled with
interrogation points. Madame Curie laughed
as if she had never noticed this before. "It is
good to have an inquiring mind, child," she said.
"I am like my children; I love to ask questions.
And when one gets an answer,&mdash;when you really
discover something,&mdash;it only leads to more questions;
and so we go on from one thing to another."</p>

<p>When Madame Curie was asked on one occasion
to what she attributed her success, she
replied, without hesitation: "To my excellent
training: first, under my father, who taught me
to wonder and to test; second, under my husband,
who understood and encouraged me; and
third, under my children, who question me!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">

  <div class="caption">Madame and Dr. Curie and their little daughter Irene
</div></div>

<p>It is the day of one of Madame Curie's lectures.
The dignified halls of the university are
a-flutter with many visitors from the world of
wealth and fashion. There, too, are distinguished
scientists from abroad, among whom
are Lord Kelvin, Sir Oliver Lodge, and Sir William
Ramsay. The President of France and his
wife enter with royal guests, Don Carlos and
Queen Amélie of Portugal, and the Shah of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Persia. The plodding students and the sober
men of learning, ranged about the hall, blink at
the brilliant company like owls suddenly brought
into the sunlight.</p>

<p>At a given moment the hum of conversation
dies away and the assemblage rises to its feet
as a little black-robed figure steps in and
stands before them on the platform. There is
an instant's stillness,&mdash;a hush of indrawn breath
you can almost hear,&mdash;and then the audience
gives expression to its enthusiasm in a sudden
roar of applause. The little woman lifts up
her hand pleadingly. All is still again and
she begins to speak.</p>

<p>She is slight, almost pathetically frail, this
queen of science. You feel as if all her life had
gone into her work. Her face is pale, and her
hair is only a shadow above her serious brow.
But the deep-set eyes glow, and the quiet voice
somehow holds the attention of those least concerned
with the problems of advanced physics.</p>

<p>Bank and wealth mean nothing to this little
black-robed professor. It is said that when she
was requested by the president to give a special
demonstration of radium and its marvels before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the Shah of Persia, she amazed his Serene
Highness by showing much more concern for
her tiny tube of white powder than for his distinguished
favor. When the royal guest, who
had never felt any particular need of exercising
self-control, saw the uncanny light that was able
to pass through plates of iron, he gave a startled
exclamation and made a sudden movement
that tipped over the scientist's material. Now
it was the Lady Professor's turn to be alarmed.
To pacify her, the Shah held out a costly ring
from his royal finger, but this extraordinary
woman with the pale face paid not the slightest
attention; she could not be bribed to forget the
peril of her precious radium. It is to be
doubted if the eastern potentate had ever before
been treated with such scant ceremony.</p>

<p>In 1911, Madame Curie's name was proposed
for election to the Academy of Sciences. While
it was admitted that her rivals for the vacancy
were below her in merit, she failed of being
elected by two votes. There was a general protest,
since it was felt that service of the first order
had gone unrecognized merely because the
candidate happened to be a woman. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
stated, however, that Madame Curie was not rejected
for this reason, but because it was
thought wise to appoint to that vacancy Professor
Branly, who had given Marconi valuable aid
in his invention of wireless telegraphy, and who,
since he was then an old man, would probably
not have another chance for the honor. As Madame
Curie, on the other hand, was only forty-three,
she could well wait for another vacancy.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the present war the
world has heard nothing new of the work of the
Heroine of Radium. We do not doubt, however,
that like all the women of France and all
her men of science, she is giving her strength
and knowledge to the utmost in the service of
her adopted country. But we know, also, that
just as surely she is seeing the pure light of
truth shining through the blackness, and that
she is "following the gleam." When the clouds
of war shall have cleared away, we may see that
her labors now, as in the past, have not only
been of service to her country, but also to humanity.
For Truth knows no boundaries of nation
or race, and he who serves Truth serves
all men.</p>

<h2>THE HEART OF HULL-HOUSE</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="dropleftmin">O</span> you remember what the poet says of
Peter Bell?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">At noon, when by the forest's edge</div>
<div class="line">He lay beneath the branches high,</div>
<div class="line">The soft blue sky did never melt</div>
<div class="line">Into his heart: he never felt</div>
<div class="line">The witchery of the soft blue sky!</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">In the same way, when he saw the "primrose by
the river's brim," it was not to him a lovely bit
of the miracle of upspringing life from the unthinking
clod; it was just a common little yellow
flower, which one might idly pick and cast
aside, but to which one never gave a thought.
He saw the sky and woods and fields and human
faces with the outward eye, but not with the eye
of the heart or the spirit. He had eyes for nothing
but the shell and show of things.</p>

<p>This is the story of a girl who early learned
to see with the "inward eye"; she "felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
witchery of the soft blue sky" and all the wonder
of the changing earth, and something of the
life about her melted into her heart and became
part of herself. So it was that she came to have
a "belonging feeling" for all that she saw&mdash;fields,
pine woods, mill-stream, birds, trees, and
people.</p>

<p>Perhaps little Jane Addams loved trees and
people best of all. Trees were so big and true,
with roots ever seeking a firmer hold on the
good brown earth, and branches growing up and
ever up, year by year, turning sunbeams into
strength. And people she loved, because they
had in them something of all kinds of life.</p>

<p>There was one special tree that had the
friendliest nooks where she could nestle and
dream and plan plays as long as the summer
afternoon. Perhaps one reason that Jane
loved this tree was that it reminded her of her
tall, splendid father.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;">
  <img id="i_image299" src="images/image299.jpg" width="282" height="381" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption">Jane Addams
</div></div>

<p>"You are so big and beautiful, and yet you
always have a place for a little girl&mdash;even one
who can never be straight and strong," Jane
whispered, as she put her arms about her tree
friend. And when she crept into the shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
of her father's arms, she forgot her poor back,
that made her carry her head weakly on one
side when she longed to fling it back and look
the world in the face squarely, exultingly, as
her father's daughter should.</p>

<p>"There is no one so fine or so noble as my
father," Jane would say to herself as she saw
him standing before his Bible-class on Sundays.
Then her cheek paled, and her big eyes grew
wistful. It would be too bad if people discovered
that this frail child belonged to him. They
would be surprised and pity him, and one must
never pity Father. So it came about that,
though it was her dearest joy to walk by his
side clinging to his hand, she stepped over to
her uncle, saying timidly, "May I walk with
you, Uncle James?"</p>

<p>This happened again and again, to the mild
astonishment of the good uncle. At last a day
came that made everything different. Jane,
who had gone to town unexpectedly, chanced to
meet her father coming out of a bank on the
main street. Smiling gaily and raising his
shining silk hat, he bowed low, as if he were
greeting a princess; and as the shy child smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
back she knew that she had been a very foolish
little girl indeed. Why of course! Her father
made everything that belonged to him all right
just because it <i>did</i> belong. He had strength
and power enough for them both. As she
walked by his side after that, it seemed as if the
big grasp of the hand that held hers enfolded
all the little tremblings of her days.</p>

<p>"What are these funny red and purple
specks?" Jane asked once as she looked with
loving admiration at the hand to which she
clung.</p>

<p>"Those marks show that I've dressed millstones
in my time, just as this flat right thumb
tells any one who happens to notice that I began
life as a miller," said her father.</p>

<p>After that Jane spent much time at the mill
industriously rubbing the ground wheat between
thumb and forefinger; and when the millstones
were being dressed, she eagerly held out
her little hands in the hope that the bits of flying
flint would mark her as they had her father.
These marks, she dimly felt, were an outward
sign of her father's true greatness. He was a
leading citizen of their Illinois community by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
right of character and hard-won success.
Everybody admired and honored him. Did not
President Lincoln even, who was, her father
said, "the greatest man in the world," write
to him as a comrade and brother, calling him
"My dear Double D'ed Addams"?</p>

<p>Years afterward, when Jane Addams spoke
of her childhood, she said that all her early experiences
were directly connected with her
father, and that two incidents stood out with
the distinctness of vivid pictures.</p>

<p>She stood, one Sunday morning, in proud
possession of a beautiful new cloak, waiting for
her father's approval. He looked at her a moment
quietly, and then patted her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thy cloak is very pretty, Jane," said the
Quaker father, gravely; "so much prettier, indeed,
than that of the other little girls that I
think thee had better wear thy old one." Then
he added, as he looked into her puzzled, disappointed
eyes, "We can never, perhaps, make
such things as clothes quite fair and right in
this hill-and-valley world, but it is wrong and
stupid to let the differences crop out in things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
that mean so much more; in school and church,
at least, people should be able to feel that they
belong to one family."</p>

<p>Another day she had gone with her father on
an errand into the poorest quarter of the town.
It had always before seemed to her country
eyes that the city was a dazzling place of toy-
and candy-shops, smooth streets, and contented
houses with sleek lawns. Now she caught a
glimpse of quite another city, with ugly, dingy
houses huddled close together and thin, dirty
children standing miserably about without
place or spirit to play.</p>

<p>"It is dreadful the way all the comfortable,
happy people stay off to themselves," said
Jane. "When I grow up, I shall, of course,
have a big house, but it is not going to be set
apart with all the other big homes; it is going
to be right down among the poor horrid little
houses like these."</p>

<p>Always after that, when Jane roamed over
her prairie playground or sat dreaming under
the Norway pines which had grown from seeds
that her father had scattered in his early, pioneer
days, she seemed to hear something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
"the still, sad music of humanity" in the voice
of the wind in the tree-tops and in the harmony
of her life of varied interests. For she saw
with the inward eye of the heart, and felt the
throb of all life in each vital experience that
was hers. It would be impossible to live apart
in pleasant places, enjoying beauty which others
might not share. She must live in the midst
of the crowded ways, and bring to the poor,
stifled little houses an ideal of healthier living.
She would study medicine and go as a doctor
to the forlorn, dirty children; but first there
would be many things to learn.</p>

<p>It was her dream to go to Smith College, but
her father believed that a small college near
her home better fitted one for the life to which
she belonged.</p>

<p>"My daughter is also a daughter of Illinois,"
he said, "and Rockford College is her proper
place. Afterward she may go east and to Europe
in order to gain a knowledge of what the
world beyond us can give, and so get a fuller
appreciation of what life at home is and may
be."</p>

<p>Jane Addams went, therefore, to the Illinois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
college, "The Mt. Holyoke of the West," a
college famed for its earnest, missionary spirit.
The serious temper of her class was reflected in
their motto which was the Anglo-Saxon word
for lady&mdash;<i>hláfdige</i> (bread-kneader), translated
as <i>bread-giver</i>; and the poppy was selected for
the class flower, "because poppies grow among
the wheat, as if Nature knew that wherever
there was hunger that needed food there would
be pain that needed relief."</p>

<p>The study in which she took the keenest interest
was history,&mdash;"the human tale of this wide
world,"&mdash;but even at the time of her greatest
enthusiasm she realized that while knowledge
comes from the records of the past, wisdom
comes from a right understanding of the actual
life of the present.</p>

<p>After receiving from her Alma Mater the degree
of B. A., she entered the Woman's Medical
College in Philadelphia to prepare for real
work in a real world, but the old spinal trouble
soon brought that chapter to a close. After
some months in Doctor Weir Mitchell's hospital,
and a longer time of invalidism, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
agreed to follow her doctor's pleasant prescription
of two years in Europe.</p>

<p>"When I returned I decided to give up my
medical course," said Jane Addams, "partly
because I had no real aptitude for scientific
work, and partly because I discovered that
there were other genuine reasons for living
among the poor than that of practicing medicine
upon them."</p>

<p>While in London Miss Addams saw much of
the life of the great city from the top of an omnibus.
Once she was taken with a number of
tourists to see the spectacle of the Saturday
night auction of fruits and vegetables to the
poor of the East Side, and the lurid picture
blotted out all the picturesque impressions, full
of pleasant human interest and historic association,
that she had been eagerly enjoying during
this first visit to London town. Always
afterwards, when she closed her eyes, she could
see the scene; it seemed as if it would never
leave her. In the flare of the gas-light, which
made weird and spectral the motley, jostling
crowd and touched the black shadows it created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
into a grotesque semblance of life, she saw
wrinkled women, desperate-looking men, and
pale children vying with each other to secure
with their farthings and ha'pennies the vegetables
held up by a hoarse, red-faced auctioneer.</p>

<p>One haggard youth sat on the curb, hungrily
devouring the cabbage that he had succeeded in
bidding in. Her sensation-loving companions
on the bus stared with mingled pity and disgust;
but the girl who saw what she looked on
with the inward eye of the heart turned away
her face. The poverty that she had before seen
had not prepared her for wretchedness like
this.</p>

<p>"For the following weeks," she said, "I went
about London furtively, afraid to look down
narrow streets and alleys lest they disclose this
hideous human need and suffering. In time,
nothing of the great city seemed real save the
misery of its East End."</p>

  <div class="caption">A corner of the Boys' Library at Hull-House
</div></div>

<p>This first impression of London's poverty
was, of course, not only lurid, but quite unfair.
She knew nothing of the earnest workers who
were devoting their lives to the problem of giving
the right kind of help to those who, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
weakness, ignorance, or misfortune, were not
able to help themselves.</p>

<p>When, five years later, she visited Toynbee
Hall, she saw effective work of the kind she had
dimly dreamed of ever since, as a little girl, she
had wanted to build a beautiful big house among
the ugly little ones in the city. Here in the
heart of the Whitechapel district, the most evil
and unhappy section of London's East End, a
group of optimistic, large-hearted young men,
who believed that advantages mean responsibilities,
had come to live and work. While trying
to share what good birth, breeding, and
education had given them with those who had
been shut away from every chance for wholesome
living, they believed that they in turn
might learn from their humble neighbors much
that universities and books cannot teach.</p>

<p>"I have spent too much time in vague preparation
for I knew not what," said Jane Addams.
"At last I see a way to begin to live
in a really real world, and to learn to do by
doing."</p>

<p>And so Hull-House was born. In the heart
of the industrial section of Chicago, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
workers of thirty-six different nations live
closely herded together, Miss Addams found
surviving a solidly built house with large halls,
open fireplaces, and friendly piazzas. This she
secured, repaired, and adapted to the needs of
her work, naming it Hull-House from its original
owner, one of Chicago's early citizens.</p>

<p>"But we must not forget that the house is
only the outward sign," said Miss Addams.
"The real thing is the work. 'Labor is the
house that love lives in,' and as we work together
we shall come to understand each other
and learn from each other."</p>

<p>"What are you going to put in your house
for your interesting experiment?" Miss Addams
was asked.</p>

<p>"Just what I should want in my home anywhere&mdash;even
in your perfectly correct neighborhood,"
she replied with a smile.</p>

<p>You can imagine the beautiful, restful place
it was, with everything in keeping with the fine
old house. On every side were pictures and
other interesting things that she had gathered
in her travels.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Addams was not alone in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
work. Her friend, Ellen Gates Starr, was with
her from the beginning. Miss Julia Lathrop,
who is now the head of the Children's Bureau
in Washington, was another fellow-worker.
Soon many volunteers came eagerly forward,
some to teach the kindergarten, others to take
charge of classes and clubs of various kinds.
They began by teaching different kinds of
hand-work, which then had no place in the public
schools.</p>

<p>"One little chap, who was brought into the
Juvenile Court the other day for breaking a
window, confessed to the judge that he had
thrown the stone 'a-purpose to get pinched,'
so they would send him to a school where 'they
learn a fellow to make things,'" Miss Addams
was told.</p>

<p>Classes in woodwork, basketry, sewing, weaving,
and other handicrafts were eagerly patronized.
There were also evening clubs where
boys and girls who had early left school to
work in factories could learn to make things of
practical value or listen to reading and the
spirited telling of the great world-stories.</p>

<p>One day Miss Addams met a small newsboy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
as he hastily left the house, vainly trying to
keep back signs of grief. "There is no use of
coming here any more," he said gruffly;
"Prince Roland is dead!"</p>

<p>The evening classes were also social clubs,
where the children who seemed to be growing
dull and unfeeling like the turning wheels
among which they spent their days could relax
their souls and bodies in free, happy companionship
and get a taste of natural living.</p>

<p>"Young people need pleasure as truly as they
need food and air," said Miss Addams.
"When I see the throngs of factory-girls on
our streets in the evening, it seems to me that
the pitiless city sees in them just two possibilities:
first, the chance to use their tender
labor-power by day, and then the chance to take
from them their little earnings at night by appealing
to their need of pleasure."</p>

<p>One of the new buildings that was early
added to the original Hull-House was a gymnasium,
which provided opportunities for swimming,
basket-ball, and dancing.</p>

<p>"We have swell times in our Hull-House
club," boasted black-eyed Angelina. "Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
floor in the gym puts it all over the old dancehalls
for a jolly good hop,&mdash;no saloon next door
with all that crowd, good classy music, and the
right sort of girls and fellows. Then sometimes
our club has a real party in the coffeehouse.
That's what I call a fine, cozy time;
makes a girl glad she's living."</p>

<p>Hull-House also puts within the reach of
many the things which their active minds crave,
and opens the way to a new life and success in
the world.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me?" a rising young
newspaper man once said to Miss Addams. "I
used to belong to a Hull-House club."</p>

<p>"Tell me what Hull-House did for you that
really helped," she took occasion to ask.</p>

<p>"It was the first house I had ever been in,"
he replied promptly, "where books and magazines
just lay around as if there were plenty of
them in the world. Don't you remember how
much I used to read at that little round table at
the back of the library?"</p>

<p>Some good people who visit the Settlement
in a patronizing mood are surprised to discover
that many of "these working-girls" have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
taste for what is fine. Miss Addams likes to
tell them about the intelligent group who followed
the reading of George Eliot's "Romola"
with unflagging interest.</p>

<p>"The club was held in our dining-room," she
said to one incredulous visitor, "and two of the
girls came early regularly to help wash the
dishes and arrange the photographs of Florence
on the table. Do you know," she added,
looking her prosperous guest quietly in the
eyes, "that the young woman of whom you
were inquiring about 'these people' is one of
our neighborhood girls? Those who live in
these dingy streets because they are poor and
must live near their work are not a different order
of beings. Don't forget what Lincoln said,
'God must love the common people&mdash;He made
so many of them.' You have only to live at
Hull-House a while to learn how true it is that
God loves them."</p>

<p>"Nothing has ever meant more real inspiration
to me," said a student of sociology from
the university, who had spent a year in the Settlement,
"than the way the poor help each other.
A woman who supports three children by scrubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
will share her breakfast with the people in
the next tenement because she has heard that
they are 'hard up'; a man who has been out of
work has a month's rent paid by a young chap
in the stock-yards who boarded with him last
year; a Swedish girl works in the laundry for
her German neighbor to let her stay home with
her sick baby&mdash;and so it goes."</p>

<p>"Our people have, too, many other hardships
besides the frequent lack of food and fuel,"
said Miss Addams. "There are other hungers.
Do you know what it means for the Italian
peasant, used to an outdoor life in a sunny,
easy-going land, to adapt himself to the ways
of America? It is a very dark, shut-in Chicago
that many of them know. At one of the receptions
here an Italian woman who was delighted
with our red roses was also surprised that they
could be 'brought so fresh all the way from
Italy.' She would not believe that roses grew
in Chicago, because she had lived here six years
and had never seen any. One always saw roses
in Italy. Think of it! She had lived for six
years within ten blocks of florists' shops, but
had never seen one!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
"Yes," said Miss Starr, "they lose the
beauties and joys of their old homes before they
learn what the new can give. When we had our
first art exhibit, an Italian said that he didn't
know that Americans cared for anything but
dollars&mdash;that looking at pictures was something
people did only in Italy."</p>

<p>A Greek was overjoyed at seeing a photograph
of the Acropolis at Hull-House. He said
that before he came to America he had prepared
a book of pictures in color of Athens, because
he thought that people in the new country
would like to see them. At his stand near
a big railroad-station he had tried to talk to
some of those who stopped to buy about "the
glory that was Greece," but he had concluded
that Americans cared for nothing but fruit and
the correct change!</p>

<p>At Hull-House the Greeks, Italians, Poles,
and Germans not only find pictures which
quicken early memories and affections, but they
can give plays of their own country and people.
The "Ajax" and "Electra" of Sophocles
have been presented by Greeks, who felt that
they were showing ignorant Americans the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
majesty of the classic drama. Thanksgiving,
Christmas, and other holidays are celebrated
by plays and pageants. Nor are the great days
of other lands forgotten. Garibaldi and Mazzini,
who fought for liberty in Italy, are honored
with Washington and Lincoln.</p>

<p>Old and young alike take part in the dramatic
events. A blind patriarch, who appeared
in Longfellow's "Golden Legend," which was
presented one Christmas, spoke to Miss Addams
of his great joy in the work.</p>

<p>"Kind Heart," he said (that was his name
for her),&mdash;"Kind Heart, it seems to me that I
have been waiting all my life to hear some of
these things said. I am glad we had so many
performances, for I think I can remember them
to the end. It is getting very hard for me to
listen to reading, but the different voices and all
made this very plain."</p>

<p>The music classes and choruses give much
joy to the people, and here it seems possible to
bring together in a common feeling those widely
separated by tradition and custom. Music is
the universal language of the heart. Bohemian
and Polish women sing their tender and stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
folk-songs. The voices of men and women
of many lands mingle in Schubert's lovely
melodies and in the mighty choruses of Handel.</p>

<p>As Miss Addams went about among her
neighbors she longed to lead them to a perception
of the relation between the present and
the past. If only the young, who were impatiently
breaking away from all the old country
traditions, could be made to appreciate what
their parents held dear; if the fathers and
mothers could at the same time understand the
complex new order in which their children were
struggling to hold their own. When, one day,
she saw an old Italian woman spinning with
distaff and spindle, an idea came to her. A
Labor Museum, that would show the growth of
industries in every country, from the simplest
processes to the elaborate machinery of modern
times, might serve the purpose.</p>

<p>The working-out of her plan far exceeded
her wildest dream. Russians, Germans, and
Italians happily foregathered to demonstrate
and compare methods of textile work with
which they were familiar. Other activities
proved equally interesting. The lectures given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
among the various exhibits met with a warm
welcome. Factory workers, who had previously
fought shy of everything "improving,"
came because they said these lectures were
"getting next to the stuff you work with all the
time."</p>

<p>Hull-House has worked not only <i>with</i> the
people but <i>for</i> them, by trying to secure laws
that will improve the conditions under which
they labor and live. The following incident
will speak for the fight that Miss Addams has
made against such evils as child labor and
sweat-shop work.</p>

<p>The representatives of a group of manufacturers
waited upon her and promised that if
she would "drop all this nonsense about a
sweat-shop bill of which she knew nothing,"
certain business men would give fifty thousand
dollars for her Settlement. The steady look
which the lady of Hull-House gave the spokesman
made him wish that some one else had
come with the offer of the bribe.</p>

<p>"We have no ambition," said Miss Addams,
"to make Hull-House the largest institution in
Chicago; but we are trying to protect our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
neighbors from evil conditions; and if to do
that, the destruction of our Settlement should
be necessary, we would gladly sing a Te Deum
on its ruins."</p>

<p>The girl who saw what she looked on with
"the eye of the heart," had become a leader in
the life and the reforms of her time. "On the
whole," one writer has said of her, "the reach
of this woman's sympathy and understanding
is beyond all comparison wider in its span&mdash;comprehending
all kinds of people&mdash;than that
of any other living person."</p>

<p>Jane Addams has won her great influence
with people by the simple means of working
with them. Her life and the true Hull-House&mdash;the
work itself, not the buildings which shelter
it&mdash;give meaning to the saying that "Labor
is the house that love lives in."</p>
